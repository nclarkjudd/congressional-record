Mr. Speaker, the world has changed. It is no \nlonger enough to just buy American; we have to sell American. We have \nto tear down these ``America Need Not Apply'' signs that are throughout \nthe world and give us a chance to sell our products and our goods from \naround this Nation that are as good as anybody's in the world.\n  My frustration, Mr. Speaker, is that the whole world is able to sell \ninto the United States. We can go down the street here into stores and \nbuy anything we want, but too much of the world is cut off to America, \nto our goods and services, especially from Texas, where we produce good \nproducts, like other States.\n  The Central American Free Trade Agreement reverses that. They have \nbeen able to sell into our country for 20 years, and for good reason, \nto help them move out of communism and socialism. But now it is our \nturn to sell our products to Central America. They are not large \ncountries by our standards, but they are large by world standards. They \nare our tenth largest customer. They buy more from us than Italy does, \nwhich is a major economic power. They are a good customer. They can buy \nmore and more of our goods and services.\n  That is just one of a number of reasons, including national security \nand winning the textile war against China, that we ought to be \nsupporting the Central American Free Trade Agreement.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BRADY of Texas", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6175", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "DR-CAFTA", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6175-4", "title": null}
