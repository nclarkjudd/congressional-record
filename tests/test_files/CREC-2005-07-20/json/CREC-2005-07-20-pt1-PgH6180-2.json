Mr. Speaker, I take this Special Order time to \naddress a most serious problem pertaining to the colony of West Papua \nNew Guinea, as it is noted and made part of the Foreign Relations \nAuthorization Act for fiscal years 2006 and 2007.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House has just passed this important legislation by \na historic vote of 351 to 78 in favor of this bill, and I certainly \nwant to personally commend the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde), the \nhonorable chairman of our Committee on International Relations; the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), our senior ranking member; the \ngentleman from Iowa (Mr. Leach), distinguished chairman of the Asia and \nthe Pacific Subcommittee; and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) \nfor their tremendous help and leadership in getting this provision \nincluded in this year's authorization bill.\n  At the outset, Mr. Speaker, I want to first extend my \ncongratulations, and I do commend the good people of Indonesia for \nhaving achieved this new milestone of their political development into \na democratic form of government. I commend the newly elected President \nof Indonesia, President Yudhoyono, and I wish him well in all his \nefforts to fight corruption and bring about democratic reforms in the \nnew government.\n  I also note, Mr. Speaker, with interest that the honorable Prime \nMinister of Australia, Mr. John Howard, is visiting us here in \nWashington. It is my sincere hope that the Prime Minister will \nseriously rethink again Australia's policy towards West Papua New \nGuinea, and I urge all Pacific nations of the Forum Organization not to \nturn their backs on West Papua New Guinea.\n  As former colonies themselves, the Forum nations should seriously \ntake the matter of West Papua New Guinea before the United Nations for \nreexamination, especially on the faulty policies that were implemented \nby the United Nations towards West Papua New Guinea in the years past.\n  Mr. Speaker, history has not been kind neither to the people of \nIndonesia nor to the people of West Papua New Guinea. Under the \nmilitary dictatorships of Presidents Sukarno and Suharto, some 1 \nmillion Indonesians were brutally murdered and killed similar to the \nkilling fields in Cambodia under Pol Pot. And by the same token, since \nthe military takeover of West Papua by the Indonesian Army in 1969, \napproximately 100,000 West Papuans were murdered, tortured, killed; and \nit continues even as I speak today, Mr. Speaker.\n  In actual fact, Mr. Speaker, according to human rights reports and \nWest Papuans themselves, actually approximately 300,000 to 400,000 West \nPapuans have been murdered, tortured to death, and disappeared at the \nhands of the Indonesian military.\n  Mr. Speaker, the United States mediated an agreement in 1962 between \nthe Dutch and Indonesia regarding West Papua, but totally without \nPapuan representation. Under the terms of the agreement, the Dutch were \nto leave West Papua and transfer sovereignty to the United Nations \nTemporary Executive Authority for a period of 6 years, after which time \na national referendum would be held to determine West Papua's political \nstatus.\n  This shift, however, did not come to pass. In fact, shortly after the \nsealing of this agreement, Indonesia violated the unambiguous terms by \nmilitary force of arms, under President Sukarno, and seized control of \nWest Papua from the United Nations.\n\n\n  Thereafter, in 1969, Indonesia orchestrated an election that many \nregard as a brutal military operation. Known as ``an act of free \nchoice,'' 1,022 Papuan elders were ``selected'' under heavy military \nharassment, and intimidation of their families, and to no one's \nsurprise, every elder voted in favor of Indonesian rule.\n  Under the ensuing decades of Indonesia military rule, West Papuans \nhave suffered as victims of one of the most repressive and unjust \nsystems of colonial occupation in the 20th century. Brutal treatment by \nthe Indonesia military has resulted in the deaths, as I said earlier, \nof some 100,000 West Papuans.\n  I am delighted to say that this bill requires Secretary Rice and the \nDepartment of State to reexamine the special autonomy law that was \nsupposed to give autonomy to West Papua. It is my understanding, Mr. \nSpeaker, that the provisions of the autonomy law that was passed by the \nIndonesia parliament, while substantive, is nothing but the paper that \nit was written on. The autonomy law, Mr. Speaker, I respectfully \nsubmit, is nothing but a sham, a complete farce, and the Indonesia \ngovernment should be ashamed for doing this.\n  Mr. Speaker, President Bush during his speech in his inauguration and \nhis\n\n\npresentation in February of this year before the Joint Session of \nCongress I believe gave one of the best speeches that I have ever heard \nconcerning democracy and the need as a commitment from our Nation to \npromote democracy throughout the world among the countries of the \nworld.\n  Since the passage of the special autonomy law 3 years ago, four key \nmeasures under the law remain unimplemented or actively violated. The \nPapuan People's Council remains nonexistent, cheating indigenous West \nPapuans of their right to representation; the funds for West Papua are \nunallocated or are allocated late, threatening their ability to meet \ntheir basic human needs; transmigration continues, overwhelming \nculturally distinct indigenous West Papuans with Indonesia migrants; \nand key governance provisions were violated when West Papua was divided \nnow into two provinces.\n  We cannot allow the repeat of history, Mr. Speaker. Rather, we must \nwork to ensure that the central government acts in concert with the \nneeds of the indigenous people of West Papua.\n  Mr. Speaker, human rights abuses committed by the Indonesia military \nover decades, including those related to environmental degradation, \nstill continue today. Under the repressive regimes of Presidents \nSukarno and Suharto, military brutality continues. The Indonesia \nmilitary and special forces have in the past 3 years alone murdered 81 \nindigenous Papuans, tortured, beaten and jailed 34 more Papuans, \ndisplaced some 6,393 families from their homes, burnt down 23 churches \nand 370 traditional houses.\n  This violation threatens to escalate. The Indonesia central \ngovernment is responding swiftly to a West Papuan announcement that \ndecisively rejects the special autonomy law, and as I speak, Mr. \nSpeaker, the Indonesia army of the government is currently transferring \nover 15,000 troops to West Papua, which is already occupied by some \n10,000 troops, composed of six army battalions, one air force \nbattalion, one battalion of mobile brigade police, which totals some \n25,000 soldiers, by far the heaviest military presence in all of \nIndonesia.\n  Mr. Speaker, these human rights issues transcend national borders. It \nis time for the Congress to no longer tolerate the human rights abuses \nthreatening the military violence and the denial of a voice under which \nthe people of West Papua have suffered for so many years.\n  Mr. Speaker, for too long, the cries of the West Papuans have fallen \non deaf ears, and I pray that with the concerted attention of the \nCongress the international community will support this effort.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6180-H6181", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "IN SUPPORT OF WEST PAPUA NEW GUINEA'S QUEST FOR FREEDOM", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6180-2", "title": "IN SUPPORT OF WEST PAPUA NEW GUINEA'S QUEST FOR FREEDOM"}
