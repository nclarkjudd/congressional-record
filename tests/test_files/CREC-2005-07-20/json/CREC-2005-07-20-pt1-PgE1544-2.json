Mr. Speaker, in 1979, a small group of health \ncare professionals and lay volunteers in Elizabethtown began meeting to \nexplore the idea of establishing a hospice in Hardin County. On April \n24, 1980, the Elizabethtown Area Hospice (EAH) served its first \npatient. The agency was staffed entirely by volunteers who provided \ncare for patients and families living in and around Elizabethtown. In \n1986, EAR became fully certified by Medicaid and Medicare. The next \nyear EAH changed its name to the Hospice of Central Kentucky (HCK) and \nexpanded its services to include five counties: Hardin, LaRue, Grayson, \nMeade, and Breckinridge. In 1989, HCK also began offering its services \nto patients living in Marion and Washington counties. In the spring of \n1990, Taylor, Green and Adair counties became a part of HCK's service \narea.\n  As the organization has grown and expanded its services, its base of \noperations has also changed. EHA was first headquartered in a small \noffice in Hardin Memorial Hospital. Over the years, HCK has moved to \ndifferent locations around Elizabethtown as the agency grew. After a \nsuccessful capital campaign in 1993, HCK moved into its new main office \nbuilding located on Diecks Drive in Elizabethtown. Since expanding its \nservices to Taylor County in 1990, HCK has operated a satellite office \nin Campbellsville.\n  A significant milestone in HCK's history occurred in 1996 when HCK \njoined with Hospice of Louisville to form the Alliance of Community \nHospices, Inc. The following year HCK received its first certification \nfrom the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.\n  During its 25 years of existence, Hospice & Palliative Care has \nprovided high-quality end-of-life care services to thousands of \npatients and their families living in the Central Kentucky area. In \n2004, HCK provided almost 30,000 patient days of care to 625 patients \nand their families. These services include pain and symptom control, \nmedication management, personal care, emotional and spiritual support, \nvolunteer assistance and bereavement care. In addition to providing \ncore hospice services, HCK also employs a children's counselor to \nprovide children and adolescents with specialized counseling and \nsupport. HCK also sponsors a grief camp, Camp Evergreen, for grieving \nchildren and their families.\n  Licensed by the state of Kentucky, HCK accepts Medicare, Medicaid and \nmany forms of private insurance. With the help of donations from the \ncommunity, HCK provides care for seriously ill patients and their \nfamilies living in the Central Kentucky area regardless of their \nability to pay for services.\n  While HCK has grown and changed in many ways over the years, one \nthing has always remained constant and that is the agency's commitment \nto providing the highest quality, most compassionate care possible to \npatients with terminal illnesses and their families. HCK dedicates its \n25th anniversary to its patients and families. Their courage and their \nfaith, in the midst of illness and loss, is a source of inspiration to \nothers.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1544", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "HONORING HOSPICE & PALLIATIVE CARE OF CENTRAL KENTUCKY", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgE1544-2", "title": "HONORING HOSPICE & PALLIATIVE CARE OF CENTRAL KENTUCKY"}
