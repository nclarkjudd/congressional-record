Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of both the \nKennedy/Hooley/Osbourne/Souder and the Hooley/Souder/Kennedy/Baird \namendments. The methamphetamine scourge that has suddenly gained \nnational attention has unfortunately been going on far too long in \ncountless rural communities, including in southwest Oregon, which I \nrepresent.\n  Almost 12.5 million Americans have tried meth at least once during \ntheir lifetime. White House Deputy Drug Czar Scott Burns recently was \nquoted as saying, ``I think we would all agree methamphetamine is the \nmost destructive, dangerous, terrible drug that's come along in a long \ntime.'' That is very true, especially in Oregon. Unfortunately, law \nenforcement is struggling to stem the spread of meth.\n  The Kennedy/Hooley/Osbourne/Souder amendment would require that the \nState Department annually certify the five biggest exporters and the \nfive biggest importers of the meth precursor pseudoephedrine are \ncooperating with the U.S. We can quickly help law enforcement \norganizations ensure that precursor chemicals are not suddenly \n``lost,'' and then used in the production of meth at international \nsuper-labs. These labs account for 80 percent of the meth used in the \nU.S.\n  This amendment will allow the State Department to use its existing \npower, that it currently uses related to heroin and cocaine, to suspend \nbilateral and multilateral assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act \nto countries that cannot account for the pseudoephedrine that enters \nand leaves their borders.\n  Also, recent efforts by Oregon's statehouse have helped to curb the \nmanufacture of meth in the state, but abuse is still on the rise. \nStates can restrict the sale of pseudoephedrine products to try to stem \nthe proliferation, but until we stop meth from spilling into the U.S. \nfrom Mexico, meth will continue to wreak havoc on families, neighbors, \ncommunities, and numerous local, state, and federal resources.\n  Meth super-labs south of the border that are producing the bulk of \nmeth that feeds the addiction of 600,000 current meth addicts, or \ntweakers. There are Mexican drug cartels smuggling meth across the \nborder daily, even as I stand before you. It is imperative that the \nU.S. clamp down on illegal border crossings that ultimately result in \nthe deaths of thousands of Americans, while lining the pockets of a \nhandful of Mexican smugglers. The border must be secure.\n  The Hooley/Souder/Kennedy/Baird amendment will increase the amount of \ncoordination between the State Department and the Mexican government, \nand between American law enforcement and their Mexican counterparts can \nonly help us defeat the meth scourge.\n  I urge my colleagues to support both the Kennedy/Hooley/Osbourne/\nSouder and the Hooley/Souder/Kennedy/Baird amendments.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DeFAZIO", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1539", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "109", "number": "3057"}], "doc_title": "FOREIGN RELATIONS AUTHORIZATION ACT, FISCAL YEARS 2006 AND 2007", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgE1539-3"}
