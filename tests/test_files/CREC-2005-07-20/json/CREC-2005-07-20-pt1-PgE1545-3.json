Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor two outstanding \nconstituents and educators from the 10th Congressional District of \nVirginia. Melissa Fye and Jim Jenkins are to be commended for their \nextraordinary efforts to bring real scientific research to the \nclassroom.\n  Melissa Fye, elementary school teacher at Ashburn Elementary School \nin Ashburn, VA, and Jim Jenkins, elementary school teacher at Mountain \nView Elementary School in Purcellville, VA, were chosen by the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to participate in the \nTeacher at Sea Program. This three-week-long research program involved \na trip to sea in the Pacific Ocean this spring. As Teachers at Sea, Ms. \nFye participated in coral reef research and Mr. Jenkins participated in \nfisheries and ocean current research.\n  Ms. Fye embarked on NOAA Ship HI'IALAKAI in Honolulu, Hawaii, and \ncruised in the waters of the south Pacific. Mr. Jenkins's cruise, on \nthe other hand, explored cold Alaskan waters, where he embarked on NOAA \nShip MILLER FREEMAN in Kodiak, Alaska, and disembarked in Dutch Harbor, \nAlaska. While onboard, Ms. Fye and Mr. Jenkins wrote lesson plans, \nmaintained daily logs, took photographs, interviewed scientists, and \nengaged in dialogue with their students, other teachers and students, \nand the general public. Ms. Fye and Mr. Jenkins participated in the \nTeacher at Sea experience in order to enrich their curriculum and \nexcite their students about the sciences.\n  In her final log, Ms. Fye wrote that she ``. . . wants [her] students \nto know that life is not a collection of things, but a collection of \nexperiences . . . [and hopes] this trip--the resources and anecdotal \nstories [she] brings back to the classroom--encourages them to explore \nopportunities as they arise in their own lives.''\n  Mr. Jenkins engaged his students each day in daily e-mail messages. \nIn one message, Mr. Jenkins told his students that he has ``. . . been \nimpressed by the cooperative spirit of everyone on [NOAA ship] MILLER \nFREEMAN,'' and, in turn, encouraged his students to work together as a \nteam while he was at sea.\n  Both Ms. Fye and Mr. Jenkins were supported by a partnership between \nthe Loudoun Education Foundation and the NOAA Teacher at Sea Program. I \ncommend the Loudoun Education Foundation, and also the Loudoun County \nschool district, for supporting the efforts of these two teachers to \npromote scientific education in the classroom.\n  I congratulate Ms. Fye and Mr. Jenkins on their spirit of adventure \nin the name of education, their willingness to try new things, and \ntheir ability to bring this experience back into the classroom.\n\n\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. WOLF", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1545-E1546", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING MS.
