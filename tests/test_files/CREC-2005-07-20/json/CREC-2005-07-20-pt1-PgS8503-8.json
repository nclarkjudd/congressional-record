Mr. President, today in the Senate we will undertake one \nof our most significant and historic constitutional responsibilities. \nThe eyes of all Americans and of history will be focused upon us. The \nAmerican people, through their votes, have entrusted us with the \nconstitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent on Supreme \nCourt nominations. They have entrusted us to govern as their elected \nrepresentatives. We must ask ourselves: How will the American people \nview us--how will history judge us--for the deliberations we begin \ntoday?\n  It is my goal the American people will say, and history will record, \nthat we were fair and thorough, that we treated our Supreme Court \nnominee, Judge Roberts, with dignity and respect, and that we worked \nexpeditiously to confirm Judge Roberts before the Supreme Court began \nits new term in October.\n  Leading up to his announcement last night, the President engaged in a \nselection and a consultation process that can be characterized with a \nfew words: ``bipartisan,'' ``inclusive,'' and ``unprecedented.''\n  The President and his White House reached out to both Republicans and \nDemocrats. He listened thoughtfully to our views and he thoughtfully \nwelcomed our suggestions on potential nominees and on the nominations \nprocess. In all, the White House contacted more than 70 Senators, \nincluding more than two-thirds of the Democratic Caucus and, of course, \nevery single member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  The President was not required by the Constitution to reach out or \nconsult. He was not required to take any time at all. He could have \nrushed through his choice. He could have nominated someone on the same \nday Justice O'Connor announced her retirement without consulting \nanyone, but he did not. The President sought input because he believed \nit was the right thing to do. I commend him for this inclusive \napproach, which I believe has strengthened the overall integrity of \nthis process.\n  Now we move to the next stage. Last night the President announced the \nnomination of Judge John Roberts, Jr., to be an Associate Justice of \nthe Supreme Court.\n  Most Americans are getting their very first glimpse of the nominee.\n\n\nWhat do we know about him? Born in Buffalo, NY, in 1955, Judge Roberts \nwas raised in Indiana with his three sisters. He ventured off to \nMassachusetts for college at Harvard and graduated summa cum laude with \na bachelor's degree in, as we have heard, only 3 years. During the \nsummers, he worked at a steel mill to help pay for college.\n  But his academic journey did not stop here. He then enrolled in \nHarvard Law School, where he once again excelled. He earned the coveted \nposition of editor of one of the most well-respected law journals in \nthe country, the Harvard Law Review.\n\n  After graduating from law school with high honors, Judge Roberts \nserved as a law clerk to Judge Henry Friendly on the Second Circuit, \nand then to William Rehnquist, who was then an Associate Justice on the \nSupreme Court.\n  In 1981, he continued his legal career at the Department of Justice \nas the Special Assistant to the U.S. Attorney General, and then as \nAssociate Counsel to President Reagan.\n  In 1986, Judge Roberts entered private practice, joining the law firm \nof Hogan & Hartson, where he specialized in civil litigation. Three \nyears later, he returned to public service as the Principal Deputy \nSolicitor General of the United States.\n  During his legal career, he has argued an impressive 39 cases before \nthe Supreme Court--39 cases. To put that in perspective, only a few of \nthe 180,000 members of the Supreme Court bar have ever argued a single \ncase before the high Court.\n  In January 2003, President Bush nominated Judge Roberts to serve on \nthe DC Circuit Court of Appeals, often referred to as the second \nhighest court in the land.\n  Upon his nomination to the appellate court, more than 150 members of \nthe DC Bar--including both Republicans and Democrats--expressed support \nfor Judge Roberts. In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, they \nwrote that Judge Roberts is ``one of the very best and most highly \nrespected appellate lawyers in the nation, with a deserved reputation \nas a brilliant writer and oral advocate.''\n  Judge Roberts' nomination was well received by the Judiciary \nCommittee and was favorably reported out of the committee by an \noverwhelming, bipartisan vote of 16 to 3, and on May 8, 2003, he was \nunanimously confirmed by the Senate.\n  I believe Judge Roberts is exactly the kind of Justice America \nexpects on the Supreme Court. He is among the best of the best legal \nminds in America. He is a mainstream conservative, someone who \nunderstands that the role of a judge is to interpret the law and the \nConstitution and not to legislate from the bench.\n  He is someone who will be fair, openminded, and impartial--not \nsomeone who will prejudge cases, predetermine outcomes, or advance a \npersonal political agenda.\n  In short, he is a Supreme Court nominee who will make America proud. \nThroughout his life, Judge Roberts has worn many hats: a devoted \nhusband and father of two, a skilled litigator, and a superb jurist. I \nam confident Judge Roberts will be an asset to the Supreme Court and \nthat he will serve with honor and distinction, just as he has on the DC \nCircuit Court.\n  As we look ahead, I do encourage my colleagues to remain focused on \nour three goals: first, conducting a fair and thorough confirmation \nprocess; second, treating Judge Roberts with dignity and respect; and, \nthird, having an up-or-down vote on Judge Roberts before the Supreme \nCourt starts its new term on October 3.\n  These goals are reasonable. These goals are achievable. There are 75 \ndays from today until October 3. It took an average of 62 days from \nnomination to confirmation for all the current Supreme Court Justices. \nIt only took an average of 58 days to confirm President Clinton's \nnominees, Justices Breyer and Ginsburg. And even though some Senators \nheld different philosophical views from these Justices--in many cases \nvastly different philosophical views--they both received up-or-down \nvotes and were confirmed by wide margins. These nominations serve as \nuseful models for us today.\n  Ultimately, I hope this process is marked by cooperation, and not \nconfrontation, and by steady progress, not delay and obstruction.\n  This morning, less than 12 hours after the President's announcement, \nsome extreme special interest groups already are mobilizing to oppose \nJudge Roberts. They are not even giving him the courtesy of reserving \njudgment until the Judiciary Committee hearings. Together, as Senators, \nwe can rise above the partisan rhetoric and obstruction that has \ngripped the judicial nominations process in the past.\n  A thorough investigation and debate on Judge Roberts does not require \ndelay or personal attacks or obstruction. A fair and dignified process \nis in the best interests of the Senate, the Supreme Court, the \nConstitution, and the American people.\n  I look forward to welcoming Judge Roberts to the Senate a bit later \ntoday. I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating him on his \nnomination to the Supreme Court.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. FRIST", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "S8503-S8504", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "SUPREME COURT NOMINATION OF JOHN ROBERTS, JR.", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgS8503-8", "title": "SUPREME COURT NOMINATION OF JOHN ROBERTS, JR."}
