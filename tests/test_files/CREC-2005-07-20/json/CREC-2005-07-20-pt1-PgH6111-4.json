Mr. Speaker, whenever President Bush is asked to \ncomment on Karl Rove's involvement in the leaking of a CIA agent's \nidentity, the President says that he cannot comment because it is an \nongoing investigation. However, if the President really wanted to know \neverything about Karl Rove's involvement, all he would have to do is \ncall Karl Rove into the Oval Office and ask him. Rove's testimony \nbefore the grand jury was not private. Rove certainly could have \nexplained his involvement so the President could then determine if Rove \ncan be trusted as a senior national security advisor.\n  There is simply no reason for President Bush to delay any longer. The \nAmerican people and our CIA agents around the world need to be able to \ntrust those with top security clearances.\n  Two years ago, President Bush talked tough about this serious issue \nsaying, if there is a leak out of my administration, I want to know who \nit is. Well, President Bush now knows Karl Rove was involved, and yet \nhe says he wants to reserve judgment until after the investigation is \ncompleted.\n  If the President really thought this was serious, he would call Rove \ninto his office and demand an explanation. It is time for President \nBush to hold Rove accountable for his actions.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. SCHAKOWSKY", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6111", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "KARL ROVE'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE LEAKING OF CIA AGENT'S IDENTITY", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6111-4", "title": "KARL ROVE'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE LEAKING OF CIA AGENT'S IDENTITY"}
