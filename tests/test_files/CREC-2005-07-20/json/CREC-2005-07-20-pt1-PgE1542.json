RANGEL\n\n                              of new york\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                         Tuesday, July 12, 2005\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000053", "text": "  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, my dear friend, Jake Pickle, has left us but \nhe will be remembered for both his accomplishments as a great \nCongressman and his ability to make everyone laugh.\n  He was a special man--a man who prided himself in his sense of \njustice and a man who could tell a ``hell of a good story.''\n  Jake Pickle and I joined the Ways and Means Committee together in the \n94th Congress. It was after Rep. Helstoski was defeated in the next \nelection, that I got the privilege of sitting next to Jake for the \nremainder of his career in the House of Representatives. What an \nexperience it was.\n  He squeaked green plastic pickles at me (from deep in his pocket) and \ntaught me how to de-shell two pecans with one hand and a single squeeze \n(and then eat them and throw the hulls under our desks with no one \nknowing). Over time, we became a team and sent juicy pecans to Members \nsitting down the row from us. Jake always thought that ``everyone \nshould have a little something in their tummies to do good work.''\n  Jake Pickle and I became close personal friends over the years (as \ndid our wives, Beryl and Alma). We could not have come from more \ndifferent backgrounds--the inner-city of New York and the rolling hills \nof Texas. Yet, he became one of the Members I respected most for his \nsheer determination, unending zeal, and ability to truly develop \nbipartisan relationships.\n  J.J. Pickle served in the Congress for 31 years representing the \nTexas 10th Congressional District--from December 1963-January 1995. All \nagree that Jake was a class act, a star, and someone to love because he \nloved back.\n  I am one of the special few who signed his red pump organ--a treasure \nof his that he took home with him to Austin upon retirement and kept in \nhis house. Signing the organ meant that you meant something to him.\n  J.J. Pickle was very, very proud of his Congressional record. He \nwould be the first to tell you that he did not seek to be famous, to be \na Senator, to be Governor, or to be President. What Jake Pickle wanted \nto be was ``The Darn Best Congressman'' for his Congressional District \nand even a better one for his country. That he was, and more.\n  Jake became Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee's Social \nSecurity Subcommittee in the early 1980s and led the charge for solving \nthe system's financial problems. (It is too bad he is not with us now \nto do it again--on a bipartisan basis and in a prudent way.) The \npicture of Pickle standing next to President Reagan signing the \n``Social Security Amendments of 1983'' is a classic of the decade.\n  Jake moved on and became Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee's \nOversight Subcommittee for 10 years. One of his proudest \naccomplishments was reforming the tax code penalties so that they were \nfair to taxpayers. His face adorned the cover of a major tax \npublication titled, ``Congress At Its Best.''\n  Pickle was relentless in many ways. Once he drafted a ``Taxpayer Bill \nof Rights;'' it was his personal goal to see it enacted into law--and \nit was.\n  Once he learned that some TV evangelists were stealing from the \npublic, it was his personal goal that they visit the Committee and \nchange--and they did.\n  Once he learned that tax-exempt organizations were being used as \nfronts for illegal activities; it was his goal that the Justice \nDepartment intervene--and they did.\n  Once he learned that workers' pension plans were not funded properly; \nit was his goal to change the law to protect retirees--and he \nsucceeded.\n  Even to the end, he was counseling us (Members and staff) about the \nissues Congress needed to ``get a rope around and move it.''\n  So I will close with the following: I missed Jake when he retired \nfrom Congress in 1995. But now I miss him more. He was a good man and \nhe will not be forgotten.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. RANGEL", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1542", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "IN REMEMBRANCE OF J.J.
