Mr. Speaker, though the two parties may disagree on aspects \nof the war in Iraq, I believe that terrorism is not a partisan issue. \nYet minority party Members choose to align themselves solely with \npolitical rhetoric and hollow accusations. Instead of joining efforts \nto enhance America's security, Democrats continue to bring \nsensationalistic banter to this floor.\n  Republicans are pushing legislation forward that will improve the \neffectiveness of and bring more accountability to U.S. foreign \nassistance around the world and bring democracy even further into the \nlight. It is no secret that terrorist groups continue to recruit and \ntrain at a rapid pace. This legislation assists in cutting off the \noutlets and supplies of terrorist organizations and helps sever their \noperational channels. We are vigorously closing their doors.\n  The foreign relations authorization addresses the pressing issues of \nour day such as U.N. reform, human rights and nuclear proliferation. \nThis legislation authorizes assistance to America's allies and contains \nmeasures that continues breaking down elements of repressive foreign \ngovernments. As terrorists seek to debase the vision of peace and tear \ndown hope, America will steadfastly provide a beacon of promise and \nallegiance.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. FOXX", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6113", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "EFFECTIVELY FIGHTING TERRORISM", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6113", "title": "EFFECTIVELY FIGHTING TERRORISM"}
