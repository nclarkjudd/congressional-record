Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 25th \nanniversary of the Workers' Strikes in Poland. In commemorating these \nstrikes, we are remembering the birth of a movement which led to the \nfall of communism in Poland and, later, Europe.\n  The strikes began as workers across Poland protested the nearly 80% \nrise in meat prices. In the northern city of Gdansk, workers protested \nin response to the dismissal of two workers on the grounds of political \nagitation. The Lenin Shipyard workers staged a sit-in and demanded the \nreinstatement of electrician Lech Walesa and crane operator Anna \nWalentynowich. The workers realized the power of their unity and chose \nto name their strike bulletin Solidarnosc or Solidarity. Soon after, \nthe first independent trade-union faction emerged and the Solidarity \nmovement was born.\n  In cooperation with intellectuals, the Gdansk Shipyard strikers \ncreated the famed list of 21 demands. The Solidarity Movement boasted \nmembers from almost all groups and social classes--all of whom opposed \nthe Moscow-backed regime. This unity was a first in the history of \nPoland. In December of 1981 the Communist government of Poland \nimplemented martial law in hopes of combating the Solidarity Movement's \nvast popularity.\n  Despite the best efforts of the communist government, another strike \nwave occurred in 1988. The regime decided it must try to share its \npower with the opposition. The elections of June of 1989 brought the \nSolidarity Movement to power and Poland was able to set up a non-\ncommunist government. The victory of the Poles served as an example to \nthe rest of Europe and is credited with leading to the historic fall of \nthe Berlin wall five months later.\n  When the Solidarity Party took power in 1989, the basic political \ntransition and the implementation of a market economy posed many \nchallenges. Furthermore, they faced the daunting task of overcoming the \nsocial mind-set resulting from years of communist rule. Nonetheless, in \nJanuary of 1990, the government sought to realize substantial reform \ngoals. The conversion was not easy and the market-economy caused an \neconomic crisis in 1992. However, true to their history, the Poles \novercame this obstacle. We should all look to our great ally as a model \nof determination, resilience and loyalty.\n  Over 11 million Americans claim Polish ancestry, nearly 900,000 of \nwhom live in my home state of Michigan. Polish-Americans, like me, are \nproud of our heritage and Poland has shown itself to be a true ally of \nthe U.S., most recently in Iraq. They have supported us in our struggle \nagainst global terrorism, in Afghanistan and assumed a leading role in \nIraq. Two-hundred Polish troops are currently serving in Bagram, \nAfghanistan and our alliance with Poland remains one of our vital \nrelationships. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in \nrecognizing the 25th anniversary of a momentous event in the history of \none of our strongest allies and greatest friends. The strikes in Poland \nwill always be remembered for their important role in Polish \ndemocratization and, consequently, the end of the Cold War.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DINGELL", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1541", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE POLISH SOLIDARITY MOVEMENT", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgE1541", "title": "RECOGNIZING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE POLISH SOLIDARITY MOVEMENT"}
