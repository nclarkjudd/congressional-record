{"content": [{"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000146", "text": "  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as we all know now, last night the President \nannounced he will nominate John G. Roberts of the District of Columbia \nCourt of Appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court. I congratulate Judge \nRoberts on this most high honor.\n  Now the Senate begins the process of deciding whether to confirm \nJudge Roberts to a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court. The Supreme \nCourt is the final guardian of the rights and liberties of all \nAmericans. Serving on the Court is an awesome responsibility, and the \nConstitution gives the Senate the final say in whether a nominee \ndeserves that trust. We should perform our constitutional role with \ngreat care.\n  Under the leadership of Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy, I \nam convinced the Judiciary Committee is in good hands. Two of our most \nrespected, experienced lawyers in the Senate are going to operate this \nhearing process. They are exemplary of how we should work on a \nbipartisan basis. Since they have taken over the responsibilities of \nthe Judiciary Committee, there has been real congeniality. Members of \nthe committee seem to be more productive. I am very happy with both \nSenator Specter and Senator Leahy.\n  It goes without saying, as we have heard from the distinguished \nmajority leader, that John Roberts has a distinguished legal career. It \nis very impressive. Both in Government and in private practice, he has \nbeen a zealous and often successful advocate for his clients. As we \nhave learned, he has argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court. For \nthose of us who are lawyers, that is what we would say is a big deal. \nBy all accounts, he is a very nice man. I have not met him. I look \nforward to doing that this afternoon.\n  While these are important qualities, they do not automatically \nqualify John Roberts to serve on the highest court in the land. Nor \ndoes the fact that he was confirmed to serve on the Court of Appeals \nmean he is entitled to be automatically promoted.\n  The standard for confirmation to the Supreme Court is very high. A \nnominee must demonstrate a commitment to the core American values of \nfreedom, equality, and fairness. Senators must be convinced that the \nnominee, John G. Roberts, will respect constitutional principles and \nprotect the constitutional rights of all Americans.\n  So the expectations for Judge Roberts are especially high because he \nhas such large shoes to fill, and I do not mean that literally--large \njudicial shoes.\n  Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has been a voice of reason and moderation \non the Court for 24 years. She has been the deciding vote in some of \nthe most important questions in our society: Questions of civil rights, \ncivil liberties, the right to privacy, and the first amendment freedoms \nof speech and religion.\n  I don't know very much about John Roberts. But one of the things I am \ngoing to look for as a lawyer, as someone who has practiced in the \ntrial bar and, to a more limited extent, the appellate level--I argued \ncases before the\n\n\nNevada Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit, but I certainly don't hold \nmyself out to be an expert in appellate law; I consider myself to be an \nexpert on the trial bar--I believe it is important that we have a \nperson on the Court who believes in precedent, stare decisis, something \nwe learned about in law school. I am hopeful that John Roberts will \nfollow along the same line he took up when he appeared before the \nJudiciary Committee last time, indicating that he believed in \nprecedent. Justice O'Connor, therefore, should be replaced by someone \nlike her in the constitutional mainstream.\n  To gather the information it needs to make this decision, the Senate \nturns, first and ultimately for our ability to get information, to the \nJudiciary Committee. As I have indicated, I have confidence that the \nJudiciary Committee will garner information that is important to the \nAmerican people and allow us to have a better picture of this man with \nhis impressive legal resume. Clearly, a judicial nominee should not \ncomment on pending cases--we all understand that--but there are many \nother questions a nominee must answer. I encourage Judge Roberts to be \nforthcoming in responding to the committee's questions and providing \nwritten materials requested by the Senate.\n  In the end, Judge Roberts must demonstrate to the Senate that he is a \nworthy successor to Justice O'Connor. To do that, he must win the \nconfidence of the American people that he will be a reliable defender \nof their constitutional rights. Judge Roberts has argued many cases in \nhis career, but this is his most important by far.\n  Since Justice O'Connor announced her retirement, I have called on the \nPresident to choose a nominee who can unite the country, not divide it. \nIt remains to be seen whether John Roberts fits that description. I \nhope that he does. I look forward to giving him the opportunity to make \nhis case to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. REID", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to address the Senate on the \nissue brought to the fore last night by the nomination of John Roberts \nto be Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Judge Roberts, as we are all beginning to learn, has an impressive \nrecord. He has keen intellect, sterling integrity, and a judicious \ntemperament. Most importantly, Judge Roberts will faithfully interpret \nthe Constitution, not legislate from the bench. He has earned the \nrespect of his colleagues, and I am confident he will make a fine \naddition to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  He was raised in middle America in Indiana, a neighboring State to my \nown State of Kentucky. Judge Roberts is a son of the Midwest who went \non to argue a remarkable 39 cases before the Supreme Court, more than \nvirtually any other member of the Supreme Court bar. He graduated summa \ncum laude from Harvard and then graduated with high honors from Harvard \nLaw School where he served as an editor of the Harvard Law Review. If \nthat were not enough, he then went on to clerk for Chief Justice \nWilliam Rehnquist, actually during the Chief Justice's period as \nAssociate Justice, and served in various positions in the Justice \nDepartment. Now he serves with distinction on the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals, often referred to as the second highest court in the land, \nand, of course, the Senate unanimously confirmed him to that position \nin 2003.\n  The President of the United States has discharged his constitutional \nobligation under article II, section 2 to nominate justices of the \nSupreme Court. He has chosen a truly outstanding nominee. It is now our \njob to provide advice and consent. In doing so, we should follow \nbasically three principles. No. 1, we should treat Judge Roberts with \ndignity and with respect. No. 2, we should have a fair process. And No. \n3, we should complete that process with either an up-or-down vote in \ntime for the Court to be at full strength for its new term beginning \nOctober 3 of this year. These principles are simple and they are sound. \nUnfortunately, the Senate has not always followed them.\n  As to the first principle, the Senate has not always treated judicial \nnominees of Republican Presidents with respect. Last Friday, for \nexample, I recounted how some of our colleagues spoke harshly about \nJustice Souter's fitness for office. Our colleagues' harsh criticism of \nJustice Souter was hardly unique. President George Herbert Walker \nBush's other Supreme Court nominee, Justice Clarence Thomas, suffered \nfar worse attacks. By engaging in an unprecedented level of \nconsultation, the President has respected the views of Senators. Now \nSenators ought to reciprocate and treat Judge Roberts with the same \ndignity and respect that we afforded President Clinton's Supreme Court \nnominees over the last 10 years.\n  The Senate did not defeat Justice Ginsburg's nomination, even though \nshe had argued in her capacity as a private lawyer for such provocative \npositions as abolishing Mother's Day and Father's Day in favor of a \nunisex parents day, and for other even more colorful positions. Those \narguably unusual positions were not held against her during her \nconfirmation process. I can recall voting for Justice Ginsburg myself. \nSimilarly, we should not caricature Judge Roberts' beliefs or views. We \nshould not attribute to him the actions of clients he has represented. \nWe certainly should not criticize Judge Roberts because his position in \na particular case did not mirror a Senator's personal policy \npreferences, nor when it comes to a fair process should we require \nJudge Roberts to prejudge cases or to precommit to deciding certain \nissues in a certain way. We should respect the fact that he may place \nhimself in a compromising position by doing so, just as we did with \nJustice O'Connor, Justice Ginsburg, and other nominees who have come \nbefore us in the past. The inquiry should be thorough but at the same \ntime fair.\n\n  Slow walking the process beyond historical norms and engaging in a \npaper chase simply to delay a timely up-or-down vote are not hallmarks \nof a fair process. The Supreme Court begins its new term on October 3. \nAs Senator Frist has pointed out, the average time for a nomination to \nconfirmation for the current justices was 62 days. The average time \nfrom nomination to confirmation for President Clinton was 58 days. \nJustice Ginsburg was confirmed in only 42 days. The Senate has 72 days \nto complete action on Judge Roberts' nomination, in time for him to \njoin the Court by the start of its new term, October 3. By any \nstandard, that is a fair goal. What is not fair and what is, quite \nfrankly, a little curious is for some of our colleagues who, before \neven having heard a single word of testimony, have already come up with \nexcuses as to why we should depart from this historical standard. It is \ndisturbing that they seek to justify so far in advance why the Court \nshould begin its proceedings at less than full strength.\n  We, on this side of the aisle, are not asking the Senate to change \nits practices or standards. We are not asking that this President be \ntreated better than his immediate predecessor. We are asking for equal \ntreatment. Let's treat President Bush's nominees as we treated \nPresident Clinton's nominees. I am hopeful that the respect the \nPresident has shown the Senate will be reciprocated and that our \nhandling of Judge Roberts' nomination will bring credit to the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. McCONNELL", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I join my colleagues in making brief \ncomments about the selection of Judge John Roberts from the DC Circuit \nCourt of Appeals to serve as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, and I follow my colleague from Kentucky in noting how Ruth Bader \nGinsburg was treated--appropriately, properly, with due diligence, and \nspeed so that the nomination went through in an orderly process. She \ntook the seat of Justice Byron White who was one of the dissenters in \nRoe. A number of my colleagues are saying we need to have somebody in \nthis position that is exactly the same as Sandra Day O'Connor in her \nposition. Yet that wasn't the standard that was applied in the most \nrecent case with Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the replacement for Justice Byron \nWhite.\n  The process is as it is. The President nominates. The President \ncampaigned vigorously about the role of the Supreme Court and the role \nof the courts in society today. He has made a noteworthy choice, a \nperson of outstanding\n\n\nacademic credentials. I have heard a colleague of mine say: I don't \nknow yet how I will vote, but I would certainly hate to argue a case \nagainst him. Somebody who has argued 39 cases in front of the Supreme \nCourt is very impressive indeed. But I also would like to note that the \nprocess is for the President to nominate and us to vote by a majority. \nThat has been the historical setting, and that is what we should \ncontinued to do in this case.\n  My colleagues have already outlined some of Judge Roberts' excellent \nlegal credentials. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law \nSchool. He clerked for then-Associate Justice Rehnquist.\n  He served as Principal Deputy Solicitor General at the Department of \nJustice. He amassed a strong record as a Supreme Court advocate in \nprivate practice and has distinguished himself as a judge on the court \nof appeals. As one of my colleagues said last night, Senator Schumer, \nJudge Roberts has the ``appropriate legal temperament and demeanor.'' \nWe would call that, from my part of the country, ``midwestern calm.'' \nHe has a great deal of calm demeanor about him that is quite good for \njudicial temperament.\n  I was particularly struck by Judge Roberts' statement at the White \nHouse yesterday evening, speaking extemporaneously and with all the \nskill of a practiced lawyer and as a person of not only a well-trained \nmind but a deep heart. He said he had a ``profound appreciation for the \nrole of the Court in our constitutional democracy.'' The role of the \nCourt in American life and Government is of great concern to the \ncountry today. That statement means a lot--rule of law rather than the \nrule of man. We are a country of laws, ruled by laws and not by the \nwhim of any person or any five people. It is a set of laws. It is a \nConstitution. That is what rules in this country.\n  It is my hope that Judge Roberts and any nominee to the Supreme Court \nwould be faithful to the role originally intended for the courts by the \nFramers of the Constitution. In our system of government, the \nConstitution contemplates that Federal courts will exercise--this is \nvery clear within the Founders--limited jurisdiction. The Federal court \nis to be a limited jurisdiction court. They should neither write nor \nexecute the laws but simply ``say what the law is,'' as former Chief \nJustice Marshall stated in Marbury v. Madison.\n  As Alexander Hamilton explained, this limitation on judicial powers \nis what would make the Federal judiciary the ``least dangerous \nbranch.'' In his view, judges could be trusted with power because they \nwould not resolve divisive social issues, short circuit the political \nprocess, or invent rights which have no basis in the text of the \nConstitution. That was simply not the role of the courts. They were \nsimply to say what the law is, not to write it, not to execute it.\n  The expanded role assumed by the Supreme Court in recent years--and \nin Federal courts generally--makes it all the more important that Judge \nRoberts exhibit proper respect for the restrained role of the Federal \ncourts in American Government. I hope the confirmation process \ndemonstrates that he will live up to the President's ideal of \nnominating individuals who will refrain from making law on the bench.\n  This is a big issue in society today. People want to have \nlegislatures to make laws. That is what we do. They want to have \nexecutive branch to execute. That is what they do. And the Court simply \nsays what the law is. It does not write it.\n\n  Speaking of the confirmation process, I will say a few words about \nwhat to expect in the days ahead. Judge Roberts hardly had a chance to \nstep before the cameras last night before interest groups had attacked \nhim. MoveOn.Org attacked Roberts as a ``right-wing corporate lawyer and \nideologue.'' NARAL Pro-Choice America blasted Roberts immediately as an \n``anti choice extremist,'' urging him to ``help save the Supreme Court \nfrom President Bush.''\n  Even though Judge Roberts was approved as a DC Circuit Court judge in \n2003, 2 years ago, without objection, and received the vote of Ranking \nMember Leahy in the Judiciary Committee at that time as well, the \ninterest groups immediately came out, before a word was said, even \nbefore the President presented him to the public, and made these sorts \nof characterizations of Judge Roberts. It is not right. It is not the \nprocess we should follow. We should look to the record of the \nindividual and we should hold open and in-depth hearings. But there \nshould not be these sorts of characterizations. These statements smack \nof personal attacks and litmus tests and are not becoming of a serious, \nopenminded debate on the nominee.\n  I hope my colleagues resist the demands from these outside groups for \nknee-jerk opposition to Judge Roberts. We should instead live up to the \ntradition of careful, considered debate, which is the heritage of this \ngreat institution. Our deliberation on this nomination should be \nrespectful and it should focus on substance.\n  It would be a tragedy for this body, and for the Republic, if the \nconfirmation process for Judge Roberts reflects the treatment some of \nPresident Bush's nominees to this point, including Roberts himself in \nlooking to be a circuit court nominee, have received. Judge Roberts' \npleasant demeanor should be matched by civil treatment in the Judiciary \nCommittee and on the Senate floor.\n  Finally, neither filibusters nor supermajority requirements have any \nplace in the confirmation process. Those tactics of obstruction should \nbecome the historical relics they deserve to be. The country deserves, \nand the Constitution demands, a prompt, thorough debate, and a fair up-\nor-down vote on Judge Roberts' nomination to the Supreme Court. I look \nforward to being an active participant in that process and also to \nhaving this debate about the role of the courts in American society and \nAmerican Government today. I think it is important that we have those \ndebates. This is an eminently qualified nominee. He deserves fair \ntreatment and a fair up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. BROWNBACK", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent).

Mr. President, I thank the Senator for that opportunity.\n  When the Court begins its term in October, we will include nominees \nspanning seven administrations and people shaped by events from \nWatergate to September 11 and beyond.\n  The Founders invested the President with the power to make \nnominations to the Federal judiciary and gave the Senate the role of \nproviding advice and consent with respect to any nominee.\n  I am pleased that after extensive and unprecedented consultation with \nthe Senate, President Bush announced Judge John Roberts as his nominee \nto\n\n\nbe the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, filling the vacancy \nleft by Justice O'Connor.\n  Judge Roberts has a distinguished record and extensive experience. \nJudge Roberts graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University and \nHarvard Law School.\n\n       Judge Roberts clerked for Judge Henry Friendly on the \n     Second Circuit and later for Justice William Rehnquist at the \n     Supreme Court. After his clerkships, he served in the \n     Department of Justice as associate counsel to President \n     Ronald Reagan before going into private practice.\n\n  After 3 years in private practice, Judge Roberts returned to the \nDepartment of Justice as Principal Deputy Solicitor General, a position \nin which he briefed and argued a variety of cases before the Supreme \nCourt.\n\n  Judge Roberts reported favorably out of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee by a vote of 16 to 3, and he was confirmed by the Senate for \nthe DC Circuit Court of Appeals by a voice vote. The Presiding Officer \nand myself were there at that time. By unanimous consent this judge was \nconfirmed.\n  I look forward to learning more about the nominee's views on the \nproper role of the judiciary at his confirmation hearings, as well as a \nthorough floor debate in which all are heard.\n  Again, and above all, Judge Roberts' nomination should be handled \nwith the utmost dignity and respect, which the position he has been \nnominated to deserves. The fact that the nominee is a person of \ncharacter and integrity will add to the tenor of the proceedings.\n  The nominations process needs to be fair, including a fair hearing, a \nfloor debate in which all views are heard, and then an up-or-down vote \non confirmation, so he can be sitting on the Supreme Court when the \nterm begins in October of this year.\n  Judges are like umpires. They should be neutral. We trust them not to \npick sides before the game begins but to fairly apply the rules. We \nshould measure our nominees on whether they will give all parties a \nfair shake and consider the merits of every dispute, not based on \nwhether we like particular results.\n  In carrying out my part in the Senate's role, I have always believed \nour Founding Fathers intended judges to interpret the Constitution \nrather than make law from the bench. The law needs to be stable and \ndependable, for the good of the whole society. I will continue to \nevaluate nominees based on whether they demonstrate competence, \nappropriate judicial temperament, and a commitment to the fair \nconstruction of our Constitution and our laws.\n  It is important that the Senate act promptly so we have a nine-member \nSupreme Court in October when the new term begins. There is no reason \nwhy that should not happen.\n  I commend the President for both his selection and the process he \nwent through to make it. Sandra Day O'Connor has been a historic and \nwise figure on the Court. I hope her legacy of grace and class will \nextend to the process by which her seat on the Court will be filled. \nWhen Ronald Reagan appointed her, it changed our Nation for the better, \nand she has been a remarkably strong and influential figure even \noutside the confines of the Court.\n  I am honored by the opportunity the people of Minnesota have given me \nto examine the President's nominee. I will render a judgment on the \nPresident's choice with the values and expectations of Minnesotans in \nmind. It is an exciting time for this country to reexamine our \nconstitutional processes and democratic institutions and come together. \nI think that is important. We have a unique opportunity to come \ntogether and have a dignified process, not to be pulled by special \ninterest groups that will try to dictate what we should do based on \ntheir beliefs rather than what is good for the country. What is good \nfor the country is to have a process in which we examine the character \nand integrity and judicial temperament of a candidate, not their \nposition on a particular case. If you look at the history of Judge \nRoberts, who was in the Solicitor General's Office, he argued cases \nthere; he did his job. Folks will say he argued that the Supreme Court \ndoesn't require taxpayers to pay for abortions. They will point to a \ncase where he defended U.S. law to protect the American flag. He was \ndoing his job and he did it well. We should be looking at whether he \ndid it well.\n  I commend the President on his choice and look forward to a \nconfirmation process of dignity, respect, and commitment to the best \ninterests of our Nation a generation into the future.\n  We pride ourselves on being the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld. This is our moment to show that to the country and the world. \nLet us do it right.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 14, "speaker": "Mr. COLEMAN", "itemno": 15}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, capping days of public speculation that maybe the \nPresident would appoint Judge Edith Clement or Attorney General Alberto \nGonzalez or any number of other people, the President made a dramatic \nevening announcement of his intention to nominate Judge John Roberts to \nsucceed Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  The President called Senator Frist, Senator Reid, Senator Specter, \nand myself last night before this announcement to discuss it. I \nappreciated his call and the reasons he gave for the nomination. As I \nsaid to him last night, he has done his part of the equation, a very \nimportant part as President. He nominates the Justice. It is \ninteresting that, in a nation of 280 million Americans, only 101 of us \nget a chance to actually have a say in who is going to serve on the \nSupreme Court, a person who is there to protect the rights of all \nAmericans on the one body that is to be the ultimate check and balance \nin our Government. Of the 101, first, of course, is the President \nmaking the nomination. But then the 100 men and women in the Senate \nhave an awesome responsibility to the rest of the Nation in how we \nvote. That is our job. The Senate has to fulfill its constitutionally \nmandated duty to ensure those who receive lifetime appointments to our \nhighest Court will protect the rights and liberties of all Americans--\nnot those of just one political party or the other but of all \nAmericans--that they will uphold our Constitution and our laws and that \nthey will be impartial in their judicial approach.\n  As I said, the President has announced his choice. Now we in the \nSenate have to rise to the challenge and get to work. To fulfill our \nconstitutional duties, we need to consider this nomination as \nthoroughly and carefully as the American people expect and deserve. \nThat is going to take time. It will take the cooperation of the nominee \nand the administration. It will require Republicans, as well as \nDemocrats, to take seriously our constitutional obligations on behalf \nof all the American people, not just a select few. I will say similar \nthings to Judge Roberts when I meet with him later today.\n  Justice O'Connor serves as a model Justice. She is widely respected \nby America as a jurist with common sense and practical values who \nbrought no agenda from the far left or the far right. She did not \nprejudge cases. She cast the critical deciding vote in a number of \nsignificant cases. Her legacy of fairness is one that all Americans \nshould want to see preserved. For 24 years on the Supreme Court, she \nhas tried to decide cases fairly and with an open mind. I thank her for \nher service to the country and her graciousness in agreeing to serve \nuntil her successor is considered and confirmed by the Senate and \nappointed by the President.\n  I regret that some on the extreme right have been so critical of her \nand so adamantly opposed to a successor who shares her judicial \nphilosophy and qualities. Their criticism reflects their own \nnarrowmindedness and biased agenda. I regret that they have taken out \nads and gone on the news trying to tarnish her record. Frankly, the \nAmerican people know better, and nothing will tarnish the record of the \nfirst woman Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I have noted that our neighbor to the north, Canada, a country that \nis only an hour's drive from my home in\n\n\nVermont, also has a supreme court with nine members, but four of them \nare women, including the Canadian chief justice. I look forward to the \ntime when the membership of the U.S. Supreme Court is more reflective \nof America as Canada's supreme court is more reflective of that \ncountry.\n  I know Hispanics across the country are disappointed the President \nhas missed this extraordinary historic opportunity to pick a candidate \nwho will make the Court more diverse. I hope he will consider that in \nfuture nominations.\n  There was no dearth of highly qualified individuals who could have \nserved as unifying nominees while adding to the diversity of the \nSupreme Court. Reports last week mentioned Judge Sonia Sotomayor of the \nSecond Circuit and Judge Edward Prado of the Fifth Circuit. Certainly \nthese are the kind of candidates worthy of consideration.\n  Judge Sotomayor was first appointed to the Federal court by President \nGeorge H.W. Bush, the President's father. Judge Prado was first \nappointed by President Reagan and elevated to the circuit by the \ncurrent President Bush. They are among the people who should be \nconsidered. There are many outstanding Hispanic judges and African-\nAmerican judges who could have added to the diversity of the Supreme \nCourt and made it more representative of all Americans.\n  Last week, Chairman Specter and I spoke about our interests in having \nthe President consider nominees from outside what I call the ``judicial \nmonastery.'' I believe their life experience is important and that the \nSupreme Court could have benefited from someone with experiences that \nwere not limited to those of a circuit judge. Certainly, this is a \nconsideration the President should make if he has further nominees. I \nwish he had done so with this nomination.\n  So now, however, the nomination has been made. The President has \nspent several weeks in determining who he wants. He has made his \nselection. Now it is the Senate's turn to decide what we will do. Above \nall, we in the Senate need to ensure that the Supreme Court remains \nprotective of all Americans' rights and liberties from government \nintrusion and that the Supreme Court understands the role of Congress \nin passing legislation to protect ordinary Americans from abuse by \npowerful special interests.\n  No one is entitled to a free pass to a lifetime appointment to the \nSupreme Court, whether nominated by a Democrat or by a Republican. And \nthere are far different considerations for the Supreme Court than there \nare for circuit courts. How the nominee views precedent, what the \nnominee regards as settled law, how the nominee will exercise the \nincredible power of a Supreme Court Justice to be the final arbiter of \nthe meaning of the Constitution--all of these raise very different \nconsiderations than those for a lower court nominee. In addition, a \nnominee coming from the appellate bench will have a record there in \nvotes and opinions and performance that will provide important \nadditional insights into his likely tenure as a Supreme Court Justice.\n\n  We have to take the time to evaluate this nominee for a lifetime \nposition on the Supreme Court. After all, if confirmed, Judge Roberts \ncould be expected to serve to the year 2030 or 2040. So we have to have \ntime to perform due diligence on Judge Roberts' record and judicial \nphilosophy. The Senators on the committee have to have time to prepare \nfor fair and thorough hearings. I ask all Senators to be mindful of the \nSenate's fundamental role in this process. The Americans put us all \nhere to do an important job, and it is critical that we treat that \nresponsibility with the seriousness and respect it deserves.\n  I start, as I always have, from the premise that the Supreme Court \nshould not be a wing of the Republican Party or a wing of the \nDemocratic Party. It has that responsibility not only to all 280 \nmillion Americans but also to millions and millions of future \nAmericans. The independence of the Federal judiciary is critical to our \nAmerican concept of justice for all. The Supreme Court provides a \nfundamental check in our system of government. We have to ensure that \nit serves as a bulwark of individual liberty against incursions or \nexpansions of power by the executive branch. We also have to ensure \nthat the Supreme Court respects the role of Congress when it acts to \nprotect Americans from those with great power, to improve their lives \nwith environmental laws, and by reining in powerful special interests.\n  We know that the current Supreme Court is the most activist Supreme \nCourt in my lifetime. Time and time again, they have set aside \ncongressional laws, some of long standing, and basically written new \nlaws of their own. There was a time when my friends on the other side \nof the aisle were very opposed to the idea of an activist Supreme \nCourt. Now we find that two of the heroes of the right are the most \nactivist members of the current Supreme Court, Justice Thomas and \nJustice Scalia.\n  Ours is a nation based on the rule of law. The test of a good judge \nis his or her ability to apply the law fairly. As I evaluate candidates \nfor lifetime appointments that often span not merely years but decades, \nI want to make sure that everybody who comes before the Court can look \nat that Justice and say: I can be treated fairly no matter who I am, no \nmatter what political party I belong to, no matter what my station in \nlife.\n  They are going to be there a long time. Justice O'Connor served for \n24 years. Chief Justice Rehnquist has served for 34 years. Since 1970, \nthe average term has been 25 years. So we are considering a nomination \nnot just for the period remaining in the Bush administration, which is \ngoing to end in 2008, but for our children's and grandchildren's \nfutures, 2030 and beyond.\n  This nomination fills the seat that Justice O'Connor occupied while \nserving as the ``swing'' or decisive vote in so many cases, and if her \nsuccessor does not share her judicial philosophy, that replacement \ncould radically change the Court in the way our Constitution is \ninterpreted.\n  It is critical we not prejudge a nominee and that the Judiciary \nCommittee be accorded the time to develop a full record on which \nSenators can base an informed judgment. I was disappointed to hear \nsomebody say last night: Why can't we move immediately to the hearings? \nCome on, the American people would justly feel on something such as \nthis that their rights have been shortchanged.\n  I look forward to working out agreements with Chairman Specter on \nprocedures to allow the kind of thorough consideration that a nominee \nto a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court deserves, and I know \nChairman Specter feels the same way.\n  A preliminary review of Judge Roberts' record suggests areas of \nsignificant concern that need exploration. We have to consider his \nservice on the circuit court, even though that is quite limited. We \nneed to understand how he will exercise judicial power.\n  An independent study--and I referred to this earlier--demonstrated \nthat the Rehnquist Court has been the most activist Court in my \nlifetime in overturning congressional enactments and restricting \nlegislative authority--actually the most activist since before the New \nDeal. The most activist members, of course, as I said earlier, are \nJudge Thomas and Judge Scalia. We need to know what kind of Supreme \nCourt Justice John Roberts would be.\n  When I talked with the President, I said I hoped that they would \ncooperate so that all relevant matters can be constructively explored \nas we begin this important process. When I meet with Judge Roberts \ntoday, I will ask for his cooperation. After all, the Constitution \nspeaks of advise and consent. It does not speak about nominate and \nrubberstamp. That, incidentally, is a position I have taken whether it \nhas been a Democrat or a Republican on the Supreme Court.\n  I look forward to hearings that will inform the Senate and the \nAmerican people in making the Senate's confirmation decision. I have \nbeen here for hearings and to vote on all nine members of the Supreme \nCourt and for one other who did not make it. Presidents come and go. \nSenators come and go. The Supreme Court Justices tend to be there a lot \nlonger than all of us. I want to make sure we do our job the right way.\n  Mr. President, I know there are other members of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee who wish to speak. In fact, I see the member of the committee \nwho has either presided over or been present for\n\n\nmore Supreme Court nominations than any Member now serving in the \nSenate. I yield to the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts.", "turn": 18, "speaker": "Mr. LEAHY", "itemno": 19}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.", "turn": 19, "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "itemno": 20}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "K000105", "text": "  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nVermont. Listening to Senator Leahy reminded us that the Judiciary \nCommittee is in good hands, with Senator Specter and Senator Leahy \nensuring we are going to have a fair, open, transparent, and timely \nhearing, the way the American people deserve. We thank him for his \ncontinued service on the Judiciary Committee and for how he is \ndeveloping this whole process. It is going to be done with great \ndignity. I thank Senator Leahy.\n  Mr. President, the nomination of John Roberts to the Supreme Court \ncomes at a time of heated debate and great division in America--a \ndebate that is reflected in the deliberations of a Supreme Court in \nwhich his vote--just like Justice O'Connor's--will affect the freedoms \nand liberties of Americans on vital questions before the country.\n  I will not prejudge the President's nominee. And I will not decide \nwhether to support or oppose him based on any single issue.\n  What all Americans deserve to know is whether Judge Roberts respects \nthe core values of the Constitution and falls within the conservative \nmainstream of America, along the lines of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.\n  That is the issue, and I look forward to asking the important \nquestions that are on the minds of Americans as they consider his \nnomination to our Nation's highest court.\n  Supreme Court nominations involve far more than the hotly-debated \nsocial issues so often discussed in the media. Presidents have 4-year \nterm. Senators serve for 6 years. But Supreme Court Justices serve for \nlife, without ever having to face the electorate. Our decision whether \nto confirm a Supreme Court nominee affects the rights and freedoms not \nonly of our generation, but those of our children and grandchildren as \nwell.\n  The Court's decisions affect whether employees' rights will be \nprotected in the workplace. They affect whether families will be able \nto obtain needed medical care under their health insurance policies. \nThey affect whether people will actually receive the retirement \nbenefits that they were promised. They affect whether people will be \nfree from discrimination in their daily lives. They affect whether \nstudents will be given fair consideration when they apply to college. \nThey affect whether persons with disabilities will have access to \npublic facilities and programs. They affect whether we will have \nreasonable environmental laws that keep our air and water clean. And \nthey affect whether large corporations are held accountable when they \ninjure workers and consumers.\n  Each of these issues--and many others--has been addressed by the \nSupreme Court in recent years. In many of these cases, the Court was \nnarrowly divided, and these issues are likely to be the subject of \nfuture Court decisions in the years to come.\n  Because so much hangs in the balance, Supreme Court nominees have a \nheavy burden to show that they will uphold justice for all. They must \ndemonstrate a core commitment to preserving equal protection of the \nlaws, free speech, workers' rights, and other individual rights. \nAmericans deserve to know if nominees will be on the side of justice \nand individual liberties, or if they will side with powerful special \ninterests.\n  The Senate's role will be to establish clearly whose side John \nRoberts would be on if confirmed to the most powerful court in the \nland. Because Judge Roberts has written relatively few opinions in his \nbrief tenure as a judge, his views on a wide variety of vital issues \nare still unknown. What little we know about his views and values lends \neven greater importance and urgency to his responsibility to provide \nthe Senate and the American people with clear answers.\n  The key question is whether he will uphold core constitutional and \nstatutory principles.\n  For instance, in a case involving the ability of Congress to protect \nthe environment, he issued an opinion with sweeping implications not \njust for the environment, but for a host of other important \nprotections. In it, Judge Roberts questioned the settled interpretation \nof the commerce clause--the constitutional provision that is the \nfoundation for not only the environmental laws that protect our natural \nheritage and ensure that we have clean air and clean water in our \ncommunities, but also for Social Security, Medicare, the minimum wage, \nand many other important national protections. I can imagine few things \nworse for our seniors, for the disabled, for workers, and for families \nthan to place someone on the highest court in the land who would put \nthese protections at risk.\n  If applied in other cases, Judge Roberts' view could severely \nundercut the ability of Congress to respond to real challenges facing \nour nation. His decision raises questions about whether he would roll \nback a host of other laws protecting civil rights, workers' rights, \ncivil rights, and even many of our federal criminal statutes.\n  I believe that most Americans would agree that we should not re-fight \nthe civil rights battles of the past. The spirit of America is to move \nforward to greater opportunity--not return to the days of second class \ncitizenship for many. Too many of our fellow citizens over many \ngenerations have sacrificed everything--including their lives--so that \nothers can fully enjoy the fruits of our liberties and freedoms. They \nhave given their all for the rights of people of color, of women, of \nthe disabled, of immigrants, of workers, of senior citizens, and so \nmany who make up the vibrant American fabric that makes our nation the \nenvy of the world.\n  So it is important to know where Judge Roberts stands on this great \nquestion of opportunity and justice for all.\n  The significance of the constitutional principles at issue is clear \nfrom the comments of other judges who serve in the same court as Judge \nRoberts. They noted that the constitutional provision he questioned not \nonly is the basis of many of our civil rights laws, but also underlies \nimportant product safety laws and environmental legislation.\n  Judge Roberts urged the full court to review the panel decision to \nreconsider the established interpretation of the commerce clause in the \nRancho Viejo v. Norton case.\n  Let me be clear. I do not prejudge Judge Roberts's nomination based \non his decision in this case or any other. Nor should anyone else. But \nwe must not fail in our duty to the American people to responsibly \nexamine Judge Roberts' legal views.\n  Other aspects of Judge Roberts's record also raise important \nquestions about his commitment to individual rights. He has opposed \nprograms to guarantee equal opportunity. He opposed the right to \nprivacy and argued to overturn Roe v. Wade, saying the case is \n``wrongly decided'' and ``finds no support in the text, structure or \nhistory of the Constitution.'' As a private attorney, he represented \ncoal companies against workers' rights. He sought to limit every \nAmerican's right to a lawyer by arguing to narrow the Supreme Court's \ncore precedent in Miranda v. Arizona.\n  Judge Roberts represented clients in each of these cases, but we have \na duty to ask where he stands on these issues. I don't prejudge them, \nbut the American people deserve to know more.\n  I join my colleagues in the hope that the process will proceed with \ndignity. But the nominee will be expected to answer fully, so that the \nAmerican people will know whether Judge Roberts will uphold their \nrights. Anything less would make the Senate a mere rubberstamp in \nSupreme Court nominations.\n  In recent days, some have suggested that the Senate should not ask \nfull questions about the nominee's legal views and judicial philosophy. \nThe President made clear that he would consider judicial philosophy in \nchoosing a nominee, and the Senate should not turn a blind eye to that \nissue.\n  When Justice Thurgood Marshall was nominated to the Supreme Court in \n1967, I said that Senators should not vote against him just because \nthey don't agree with him on every issue. But that is different from \nsaying we should not consider judicial philosophy at all. Particularly \ntoday, when philosophy is important to the White House in choosing \nnominees, Senators should consider it as well.\n\n\n  To be clear, here is what I said in 1967:\n\n       I believe it's recognized by most Senators that we are not \n     charged with the responsibility of approving [justices] if \n     [their] views always coincide with our own . . . We are \n     really interested in knowing whether the nominee has the \n     background, experience, qualifications, temperament, and \n     integrity to handle this most sensitive, important, and \n     responsible job.\n\n  But if someone would clearly fail to uphold basic rights, that should \nbe considered and the Senate is entitled to know.\n  There are few debates more important than this one, and I look \nforward to considering this important nomination.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 20, "speaker": "Mr. KENNEDY", "itemno": 21}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson).
