Mr. Speaker, I sit here a bit incredulously \nlistening to my colleagues brag about U.S. trade policy. The reason \nCAFTA has not come for a vote, even though it has been promised to have \nbeen brought forward four times, is because Democrats and Republicans \nand small manufacturers and labor and small ranchers and family farmers \nand environmentalists and religious leaders in Central America and \nreligious leaders in this country oppose the Central American Free \nTrade Agreement.\n  Why? Because a dozen years ago we had a $38 billion trade deficit in \nthis country. Last year we had a $618 billion trade deficit. That has \ntranslated into 3.5 million lost manufacturing jobs in the last 5 years \nalone.\n  Our trade policy, Mr. Speaker, simply is not working. It may be \nworking for investors, but it is not working for farmers, it is not \nworking for small business. It is not working for consumers and \nenvironmentalists and workers and for our communities.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BROWN of Ohio", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6174", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "CAFTA IS NOT WORKING", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6174-5", "title": "CAFTA IS NOT WORKING"}
