Mr. Speaker, I just heard a quote on the floor of the \nHouse of Representatives to send product to Central America or send \ntroops. I have never heard anything more absurd or simplistic in my 9 \nyears here in the House of Representatives. The people of these six \ncountries oppose CAFTA. They say it is unfair. And it really is a \ncorporate-inspired trade deal that hurts working people both in the \nUnited States and Central America.\n  Stop the hemorrhaging of American jobs. Protect American sovereignty. \nPut some backbone into both sides of the aisle on the independence of \nthe legislative body. CAFTA is not only a spear into the heart of \nAmerican independence but a heavy blow to the integrity of this House \nunder Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution.\n  Do we have the backbone to stand for the common good, the basis for \nthe Judeo-Christian foundation of this Nation? Or do we just invoke \nthese principles when convenient?\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PASCRELL", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6113", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "CAFTA", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6113-2", "title": "CAFTA"}
