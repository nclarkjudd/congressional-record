Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the recent \nselection of the Louisville Youth and Children's Choir to represent \nKentucky and perform in the 2006 Mozart Youth Choral Festival in \nSalzburg and Vienna, Austria, in celebration of the 250th anniversary \nof Amadeus Mozart's birth. Receiving the opportunity to perform in \nAustria, home of the musical capital of the world, is a great honor and \nwonderful experience for these young musicians.\n  Founded in 1967 by Italio Taranta, a former Professor of Music and \nChoral Conductor at the University of Louisville School of Music, the \nLouisville Youth and Children's Choir is the city's premier children's \nand youth choral training program, composed of young talent throughout \nmetropolitan Louisville representing\n\n\ngrades 4-12. Its repertoire has as much diversity as it has breadth, \nincorporating music from a broad range of cultural styles, from key \nclassical and modern works to voice and instrumental soloist \nperformances.\n  Invitation to this international music festival is a testament to the \nLouisville Youth and Children's Choir's passion for excellence in \nsinging and choral performance, which has captivated audiences for \nnearly thirty years. Thanks in no small measure to Mr. Don Scott \nCarpenter, Executive Director, and Mrs. Terri E. Foster, Director of \nOperations, the Louisville Youth and Children's Choir will be sharing \ntheir talents with their European peers and perhaps, new musical \nfriendships will form as a result.\n  Next summer, the hills will indeed be alive with the sound of music. \nThe Louisville Youth and Children's Choir will be performing in two of \nthe original venues where Amadeus Mozart himself performed: the \nSalzburg Dom (or Cathedral) and the Votivkirche (Votiv Church) in \nVienna. In fact, not only did Mozart perform here but he was also \nemployed as the Cathedral's Choral Director. In addition to visiting \nthe many historical, artistic and cultural sites in Austria, the \nLouisville Youth and Children's Choir will have the great honor of \nperforming under the co-directorship of Janos Czifra, who is the \nCathedral's present Choral Director, and Dr. Z. Randall Stroope, one of \nAmerica's foremost conductors and composers. I can only imagine the \nthrill this must be for a group of young music performers and \nenthusiasts.\n  I am incredibly proud of such a talented group of artists which, next \nyear, will find itself immersed with the sights and sounds that \ninspired some of the world's greatest musical geniuses such as Haydn, \nBeethoven, Schubert, and Strauss. Mozart mastered his first piece when \nhe was five years old and, in time, performed before French and English \nroyal courts. In their own special way, these young artists will be \nfollowing in Mozart's footsteps when they perform in the great halls of \nhistory.\n  Mr. Speaker, I join the state of Kentucky in praising the Louisville \nYouth and Children's Choir for their persistence and hard work. I would \nlike to offer heartfelt congratulations for this most recent honor and \nI wish them the very best in Austria.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mrs. NORTHUP", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1544-E1545", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "LOUISVILLE YOUTH CHOIR TO TOUR AUSTRIA IN JUNE 2006", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgE1544-4", "title": "LOUISVILLE YOUTH CHOIR TO TOUR AUSTRIA IN JUNE 2006"}
