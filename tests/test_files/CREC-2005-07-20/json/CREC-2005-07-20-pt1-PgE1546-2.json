Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, the United States Congress will \nwelcome His Excellency Dr. Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of the \nRepublic of India.\n  His visit to the United States, and to this House in particular, is a \nsymbol of the strong and vibrant relations between our two nations, the \noldest and largest democracies on earth.\n  But the relationship between the United States and India is more than \nsymbolic.\n  It is the natural alliance between democratic nations who value \nfreedom, and will defend their people from tyranny and terror.\n  Since the Indian people achieved their independence from the British \ncrown in 1947, their nation has become an example of political freedom \nand stability in a region that desperately needs it.\n  India's economy has become a global leader in trade, science, and \nhealth, and its education system annually produces some of the \nbrightest and most innovative minds in the world.\n  India has become a valued trading partner with the United States, and \na trusted ally in the global war on terror.\n  Internationally, the Indian people--together with Pakistan--in recent \nyears have sought peaceful solutions to their differences, setting \naside decades of open hostility.\n  And here at home, Indian-Americans have enriched our national culture \nby introducing generations of Americans to the philosophical, \nreligious, and social traditions of their homeland.\n  My own district in the Houston region is home to tens of thousands of \nIndian-Americans, who have become an indelible part of our community in \nrecent decades, a fact for which I and my fellow Texans are most \ngrateful.\n  I am proud to sponsor this resolution commending Prime Minister Singh \nand his nation, and welcoming him to address the House and Senate \ntomorrow.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DeLAY", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1546", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "COMMENDING THE CONTINUING IMPROVEMENT IN RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE REPUBLIC OF INDIA", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgE1546-2", "title": "COMMENDING THE CONTINUING IMPROVEMENT IN RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED  STATES AND THE REPUBLIC OF INDIA"}
