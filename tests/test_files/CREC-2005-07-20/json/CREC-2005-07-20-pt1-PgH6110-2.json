Mr. Speaker, this week on the floor the House will \nconsider the reauthorization of the USA PATRIOT Act and all Members \nfrom both sides of the aisle will, 4 years after 9/11, have an \nopportunity to show the American people how seriously they take the \nongoing threat of terrorism and how they would attempt to combat it.\n  The PATRIOT Act, as we all know, has been a political punching bag \nfor many ever since its passage. Wild, fear-mongering accusations have \nabounded about the suppression of dissent and abuse of power, yet in \nthe PATRIOT Act's 4-year history no such abuses have been documented. \nIt has not infringed on anyone, except our terrorist enemies.\n  Unfortunately, too often, too many seem more critical of the actions \nof our own troops than those of the terrorists. And comical as it \nsounds, such reckless, irresponsible, partisan rhetoric is invariably \nprefaced with, ``I support the troops, but.''\n  But you cannot, Mr. Speaker, you cannot support the troops, but \ncompare them to Nazis. You cannot support the troops, but call their \nheroic work in Iraq a ``grotesque mistake.'' You cannot support the \ntroops, but say Saddam Hussein's torture chambers are still open, but \nunder new ``U.S. management.'' You cannot support the troops, but say, \nto score partisan points, that the war in Afghanistan is over, when \nthose very troops are still in harm's way there.\n  Policy differences are healthy, Mr. Speaker, but words have \nconsequences.\n  National security is more than just another political issue. \nUndermining the war on terror undermines the troops, emboldens the \nenemy, and endangers our young men and women in uniform.\n  As much as some would like to, we cannot pretend it is September 10 \nagain. We cannot pretend the world is safe. Mr. Speaker, 9/11, Madrid, \nand London have proven that. Our only choice is to fight or surrender \nand, for 4 years, the American people have rallied behind our Commander \nin Chief, committed to fight this war until the last terrorist on earth \nis either in a cell or a cemetery.\n  The Democrat Party of FDR and JFK, like the Republican Party under \nRonald Reagan and George Bush, understood the necessity of strong, \ndecisive, and bipartisan foreign policy in a dangerous world. This \nweek's agenda will provide all Members from both sides of the aisle the \nopportunity to affirm whether such bipartisan unity is still possible.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DeLAY", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6110", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "USA PATRIOT ACT REAUTHORIZATION", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6110-2", "title": "USA PATRIOT ACT REAUTHORIZATION"}
