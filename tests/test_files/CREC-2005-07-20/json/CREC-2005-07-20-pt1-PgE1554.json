Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an outstanding \nnewspaper publisher and business entrepreneur who pursued a successful \ncareer in business while remaining rooted in the community and opening \nmany doors of opportunity for others. Mr. John L. Procope was an \nimportant voice in Harlem politics, society, and education and his \ninfluence and impact was felt beyond his home community in the City of \nNew York and the nation. He passed away on July 15, 2005.\n  In 1971, John and a group of five co-owners bought the Amsterdam News \nin Harlem and\n\n\nkept an important black newspaper alive and running in a community that \nneeded and wanted to be kept abreast of events in Black America. \nThrough his work as the paper's publisher, he ensured that the \ncommunity was aware of issues of importance to them and knowledgeable \non the events of the day.\n  Through his ownership of the Amsterdam News, he worked to inform, \neducate, and activate a community which had suffered through difficult \ntimes and knew that to improve their stake in society they would have \nto be diligent on the issues. He did not stray from controversial \ntopics or fail to express his opinions in the best interest of his \ncommunity.\n  Following the riots in reaction to the 1977 blackout in New York, \nJohn was outraged by the reaction of the black community and readily \nexpressed his criticism of young alienated Blacks and the lack of black \nleadership in properly addressing the situation and providing hope for \nfuture generations. John would later head up the Emergency Aid \nCommission to provide grants to local businesses harmed by the looting \nthat ensued from the blackout. He impressed upon the community and its \npolitical and social leadership the importance of building up and \nsupporting local businesses, rather than tearing them down and \ndestroying their economic ability.\n  John Procope saw the value of investing in local businesses in our \ncommunities. He encouraged entrepreneurs to not only provide jobs to \nyoung people and the poor, but to provide opportunities to develop \ntheir skills and nurture their talents within the community. John and \nErnesta, his wife, were strong advocates of the Fair Access to \nInsurance Requirements plan in 1968 and have continued to work in \nhighly visible ways to address critical issues and to support \nhumanitarian and cultural causes within the community.\n\n  Though John passed away at the age of 82, he led a full and rewarding \nlife. He championed the good causes, fought the right fights, and \ndemanded the most of himself and others. I knew him as an exceptional \nindividual and a trusted friend. The attached obituary from the New \nYork Times (July 18, 2005) highlights the life story and \naccomplishments of Mr. Procope.\n\n   John L. Procope, 82, Publisher of Black Newspaper in Harlem, Dies\n\n       July 18, 2005.--John L. Procope, an entrepreneur and former \n     publisher of The New York Amsterdam News, died on Friday. He \n     was 82 and lived in Queens.\n       The cause was complications from pneumonia, according to E. \n     G. Bowman Co., where he had served as chairman.\n       Mr. Procope, a graduate of Morgan State University, was a \n     marketing and advertising executive at several companies \n     before he joined a consortium that bought The Amsterdam News, \n     a black newspaper based in Harlem, in 1971. He was one of six \n     co-owners of the newspaper when he succeeded Clarence B. \n     Jones as publisher in 1974.\n       After the 1977 blackout and the resultant looting, Mr. \n     Procope broke the traditional restraint of vocal criticism \n     against other prominent blacks.\n       He published a blistering front-page editorial that \n     contended that there was a ``massive vacuum of leadership in \n     the black communities across the city.''\n       The editorial said that since black leaders ``hadn't \n     exercised real leadership prior to the blackout, there was no \n     established communication with our young people to use as a \n     base for communication when the looters began.''\n       He was appointed chairman of the seven-member Emergency Aid \n     Commission, which disbursed about $3 million in grants to \n     businesses hurt by the looting.\n       In the late 1970's, two co-owners of The Amsterdam News \n     tried to remove Mr. Procope as publisher, saying that \n     business contracts his wife, Ernesta G. Procope, had with the \n     city resulted in a conflict of interest--a contention the \n     Procopes denied.\n       Mr. Procope left the newspaper in 1982 to focus on E. G. \n     Bowman, an insurance company that had been founded by his \n     wife that was one of the first major African-American-owned \n     businesses on Wall Street. The company's client list started \n     with underserved Brooklyn homeowners but grew to include \n     Fortune 500 companies.\n       Mr. Procope and his wife were a driving force behind the \n     creation of the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements plan in \n     1968 to help make insurance available to all residents of New \n     York State. He and his wife were also highly visible in \n     political and philanthropic circles.\n       In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sisters, Dr. \n     Jean Martin of Bloomfield, Conn.; and Jonelle Terrell of \n     Manhattan.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. RANGEL", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1554-E1555", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "MR.
