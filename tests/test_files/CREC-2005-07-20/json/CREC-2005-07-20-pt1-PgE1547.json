Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the groups and \nindividuals who made the Prairie Horizons Trail a reality for \nSoutheastern Colorado. It has been an extremely long process, but the \nhard work has come to fruition with the official opening of the Prairie \nHorizons Trail. This trail is a part of the TransAmerica Bicycle Trail.\n  This trail crosses the United States from Yorktown, VA to Astoria, OR \nand it passes through the beautiful Eastern Plains of Colorado's 4th \nCongressional District, with more than 100 miles of Highway 96.\n  Eastern Colorado communities and counties have come together to work \non a plan for the trail corridor in the region, which has been named \nthe Prairie Horizons Trail.\n  On July 1,2005 Joy Lujan with the National Parks Service and Janet \nFrederick, Executive Director for the Kiowa County Economic Development \nFoundation, were met in Sugar City, Ordway, Crowley, and Olney Springs \nby county commissioners, mayors and community activists as the Prairie \nHorizons trail was officially opened.\n  Lujan and Frederick presented business owners with commemorative \n``Cyclists Welcome'' signs and spoke briefly about the new brochures \nabout the trail.\n  I am proud to represent Crowley County Commissioners Dwight Gardner \nand Matt Heimerich along with Sugar City Councilwoman Eleanor Neiffert, \nOrdway Mayor Nancy Moore, Wendy Pettit with the Colorado Department of \nTransportation, Crowley County School Superintendent John McCleary, \nOlney Springs Mayor Deb DeVore, and the many other citizens who \nassisted in making this project possible. This is a wonderful addition \nto the Eastern Plains and to the communities in which this trail \npasses. It is my great honor to recognize the opening of the Prairie \nHorizons Trail.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mrs. MUSGRAVE", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1547", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "PRAIRIE HORIZONS TRAIL OFFICIALLY OPENS", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgE1547", "title": "PRAIRIE HORIZONS TRAIL OFFICIALLY OPENS"}
