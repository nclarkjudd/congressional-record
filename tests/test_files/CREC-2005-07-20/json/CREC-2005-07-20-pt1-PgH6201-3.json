Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my fellow collegues \nand Greek Cypriots through the world in remembering the 31st \nanniversary of the tragic invasion and occupation of Cyprus by Turkish \narmed forces.\n\n\n  On July 20, 1974, Turkey invaded the sovereign Republic of Cyprus and \nplaced 37 percent of its territory under military occupation. Over the \npast 31 years, two hundred thousand Greek Cypriots have been expelled \nfrom their homes and forced to live as refugees. This illegal \noccupation persists today, infringing upon principles of national \nsovereignty and violating the Cypriots' natural right of self-\ndetermination.\n  On this day, as we remember the victims of the Turkish invasion of \nCyprus, I urge my colleagues and the world to support the Greek Cypriot \nconcerns about the reunification process. Greek Cypriots want Cyprus \nunited under a plan that will provide a just, fair, and long-term \nsolution to the Cypriot problem. And they deserve nothing less. Any \nreunification plan must uphold democratic and human rights for all \nCypriots. It must resolve property rights issues for Greek Cypriots and \nit must significantly demilitarize the island. Let me be clear--a plan \nthat is unacceptable to 76 percent of Greek Cypriots cannot be \nacceptable to the United States or to the international community.\n  I also urge Congress to use this day of remembrance to honor other \nvictims of Turkish injustice. Today, Turkey continues to violate the \nreligious rights and freedoms of the Ecumenical Patriarch, spiritual \nleader to millions of Orthodox Christians around the world. The \nGovernment of Turkey refuses to recognize the Ecumenical Patriarchate's \ninternational status, continues to impede training for the clergy, \nrefuses to reopen the theological institute at Halki, and has \nconfiscated or levied retroactive taxes on Ecumenical Patriarchal \nproperties.\n  I am pleased that I was able to include language on the Ecumenical \nPatriarch in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, which passed the \nHouse of Representatives today. This language calls on Turkey to \nimmediately eliminate all forms of discrimination, particularly those \nbased on race or religion. It also calls on Turkey to pledge to \nmaintain and protect religious and human rights without compromise.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in solemnly commemorating the \n31st anniversary of the invasion of Cyprus. I further ask you to stand \nfirmly with the people of Cyprus in their quest to achieve \nreunification and justice for Cyprus. The U.S. should not turn its back \non the peaceful aspirations of the Cypriot people. Justice dictates \nthat Turkish troops should leave the occupied parts of northern Cyprus, \nand that the Cypriot people--both Greek and Turkish alike--can reunify \nand enjoy the benefits of peace with justice and the benefits of being \nmember of the EU.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. MENENDEZ", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6201-H6202", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "31ST BLACK ANNIVERSARY OF THE TURKISH INVASION OF CYPRUS", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6201-3", "title": null}
