Mr. President, today, we will be voting on final passage \non the Foreign Operations appropriations bill. I want to take this \nopportunity to thank my colleagues for their tremendous work and, in \nparticular, Senator McConnell for his stewardship of this bill.\n  Diplomacy and foreign policy are the essential pillars of our \nnational security. They reflect the values, principles, views, and \ninterests of the people we represent, the American people. They are \ncentral to advancing the U.S. role and our place, our stature, in the \nworld.\n  America's national security depends on our ability to integrate and \ncoordinate all of the elements of our national power. It includes \ndiplomacy, intelligence, economic strength, and military might.\n  The Foreign Operations bill advances those efforts and demonstrates \nour generosity and our priorities. The legislation provides $9.7 \nbillion to ensure that the Department of State and other related \nagencies and our personnel serving overseas have the tools, the \nequipment they need to advance America's security.\n  In the past year, freedom movements have swept the globe--in Ukraine, \nin Georgia, the elections in Afghanistan and Iraq, Lebanon, and the \nPalestinian territories--and have inspired literally millions around \nthe world. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Egypt have also taken demonstrable \nsteps toward democracy. Having visited most of those countries, and \nhaving had the opportunity to speak directly to senior officials in \neach, I have seen real changes, impressive changes.\n  The spread of democracy unifies our values, unifies our national \ninterests. As Americans, we believe every person has the right to live \nin a free society where they can choose their own leaders, have a hand \nin their own destiny, and secure a bright future for their children. \nAnd democracy, along with all the hope and progress it brings, creates \npeace and stability between the United States and our friends and \nallies.\n  The Foreign Operations bill provides $120 million for the Middle East \nPartnership Initiative to help spread democracy among the Arab people. \nBy promoting economic, educational, and political reform in the Middle \nEast, we marginalize our terrorist enemies. They lose their state-\nsponsored safe havens, they lose potential recruits, and they lose the \nability to exploit political grievances for terrorist gain.\n  Democracy provides an engine for the people, not the terrorists, to \nwin, to take responsible and peaceful action to better their lives, \ntheir countries, and hold their leaders accountable. The United States \nmust continue to provide support to the activists and reformers in the \nMiddle East. These heroes make great sacrifices for the cause of \nfreedom, and they are critical allies in our fight against terrorism.\n  We must also continue to support our work providing aid and \nhumanitarian relief. America leads the world in providing international \naid. But too often international aid money never reaches the very \npeople it is intended to help. It is stolen or wasted by corrupt or \ninefficient governments. That is why this bill strengthens \naccountability requirements. The Millennium Challenge Corporation \nrequires recipient governments to take clear steps, verifiable steps, \nto govern justly in an open, transparent democratic way, to invest in \npeople by improving education and health care, to promote economic \nfreedom so their economies can grow and provide jobs. Against this \nbackdrop, aid money can do the most good.\n  Today, many throughout the developing world--particularly in Africa, \nwhere I was 2 weeks ago--suffer from devastating diseases. We know \nthem: HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria. These deadly diseases have the \npotential to decimate entire populations and to prevent those nations \nfrom ever becoming modern, prosperous countries.\n  The legislation before us allocates $2.9 billion for the President's \ninitiative against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Two billion of \nthat total is directed to the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative, $400 million \ncovers our contribution to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, \nand malaria. In total, the bill allocates $203 million above the budget \nrequest for this coming fiscal year. These funds are targeted to help \nwhere it is needed most. They zero in on the 15 countries in Africa, \nAsia, and the Caribbean.\n  I again thank my colleagues and the President of the United States \nand the American people for their generosity and for their leadership \nin this great humanitarian effort.\n  A number of other health-related programs are also incorporated into \nthe foreign operations bill--$1.6 billion has been allocated for the \nChild Survival and Health Programs Fund. This includes $375 million for \nchild survival and maternal health, which is an increase of $49 million \nabove last year's level. In addition, this funding includes $30 million \nfor vulnerable children and an additional $285 million for infectious \ndiseases.\n  Today, around the world, there are more than 600,000 pregnancy-\nrelated deaths and more than 4 million deaths among newborn babies per \nyear. Most of these tragedies are preventable. The Foreign Operations \nbill provides $375 million to prevent these deaths.\n  Many of these problems we see around the world stem from the lack of \navailable clean drinking water and proper sanitation in many regions of \nthe world. Water-related illnesses pose fatal threats to vulnerable \npopulations, especially children.\n  Every 15 seconds a child dies from a disease contracted from unclean \nwater. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 1.1 \nbillion around the world lack access to clean, safe water sources; 2.6 \nbillion people lack access to basic sanitation.\n  As a result, approximately 1.8 million people die very year from \ndiarrheal disease. Ninety percent of those deaths occur in children \nunder the age of 5.\n  And if we do nothing, with an increasing world population and further \nconstraints on our world's water resources, the problem is only \nexpected to get worse.\n  I commend the assistant majority leader, Senator McConnell, the \nchairman of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, for \nproviding $200 million to the U.S. Agency for International Development \nfor safe water programs in his bill. Fifty million dollars of that \namount is targeted to programs in Africa where the need is great.\n  Private, nonprofit sector programs are also working hard, including \nthe Millennium Water Alliance, Water for People, Water Leaders \nFoundation, and Living Water International. These groups are dedicated \nto delivering comprehensive, safe water technologies throughout the \nglobe.\n  Some are building major infrastructures. Some are digging wells and \nproviding hand pumps to villages. Others are developing lightweight, \nlow-cost, low-energy water purification systems that could be available \nto distribute to communities, schools, and orphanages for combating \nwater-related diseases in Africa.\n  I commend all of these organizations for their dedication and \ncompassion. Together we are working to make this an International \nDecade for Action known. In 10 years, we intend to cut in half the \nnumber of people around the globe who lack access to safe, clean water.\n  Another demonstration of America's compassion is our work with the \neffects of civil strife, especially war and\n\n\nviolence. This appropriations bill will provide $74 million for the \nConflict Response Fund to assist in stabilizing and reconstructing \ncountries impacted by conflict or civil strife.\n  In addition, $900 million is allocated for Migration and Refugee \nAssistance and $40 million for the Emergency Refugee and Migration \nAssistance Fund.\n  Unlike many donor countries, the United States strives to ensure that \nforeign assistance is effective, that it is distributed to those who \nneed it the most, and that it gets measurable results.\n  In addition to foreign aid, the foreign operations bill also \naddresses the most dangerous threats we face today--the spread of \nweapons of mass destruction and the global war on terrorism. This bill \nprovides $440 million for nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, and other \nrelated programs.\n  We are working closely with our friends and allies to secure \nstockpiles of WMD-related materials and technology, and make sure that \nthey have the capability to protect these sensitive materials.\n  The bill also provides funding and assistance for our coalition \npartners in the global war terrorism. The legislation includes $4.6 \nbillion for foreign military financing.\n  This funding, along with other national resources committed by our \ncoalition partners, is essential for improving the capabilities of our \ncoalition allies so that they can continue to make their vital \ncontributions to this global effort.\n  The $86 million allotted for the international military education and \ntraining programs will ensure that our allies maintain the ability to \nwork closely with American forces on the battlefield and take \nindependent initiative to the fight against terrorism.\n  The United Nations also has an important role to play in the advance \nof democracy and the fight against terror. The world organization \nprovides a medium for nations to discuss and resolve differences \npeacefully through dialogue and diplomacy.\n  It also monitors particular international agreements to ensure that \nnations are fulfilling their obligations and commitments. The U.N. is \nalso critical to organizing and providing humanitarian and other \nassistance to the world's most desperate regions.\n  In order to carry out these functions effectively, however, the U.N. \nmust undergo serious reform.\n  The United Nations needs to take action against its officials who are \nguilty of waste, fraud, and abuse. And it must also take steps to make \nthe organization as a whole ore accountable, transparent, and \nefficient.\n  The United Nations has many positive contributions yet to make. But, \nin order to fulfill its mission, it must do more to clean house.\n  America's foreign policy reflects the values, beliefs and culture of \nthe American people and the history of our great Nation. By advancing \nour values abroad, the United States not only makes the world a better \nplace, it makes it a safer place, too.\n  As a free people, we are duty bound to share the blessings of liberty \nwith citizens around the globe.\n  Our generation, no less than the one before, is compelled to confront \nthe challenges of our times--and to fulfill America's destiny, in the \nwords of the Great Emancipator, as mankind's last, best hope.\n\n\n                                 sudan\n\n  Last night, the Senate passed a resolution to support the fragile \npeace process between the government in Khartoum and the southern \nSudanese. I applaud my colleagues for their compassion and concern for \nthis troubled region of the world.\n  The resolution calls upon the U.S. Government to closely monitor the \npeace process now underway. It also focuses our attention to the \ncontinuing crisis in Darfur, and calls for continued pressure on \nKhartoum to end its genocidal campaign and bring justice to the \ncriminals who have ravaged the people and the land of Darfur.\n  Eleven days ago, the leaders of Sudan took an historic step.\n  John Garang, leader of the Sudanese Liberation Army, returned to the \ncapitol of Khartoum for the first time in 21 years to be sworn in as \nSudan's vice president. Dr. Garang told the cheering crowd over a \nmillion strong, ``My presence here today in Khartoum is a true signal \nthat the war is over.''\n  Together, he and President Bashir signed a new interim constitution \nofficially forming the National Unity Government of Sudan. Under this \nagreement, Sudan will enter a 6-year interim period. At the 4-year \nmark, nationwide elections will be held at the provincial level, as \nwell as for the national legislature. The interim period will culminate \nwith a vote by the people of southern Sudan deciding their political \nfuture.\n  After two decades of brutal civil war that has killed 2 million \npeople and displaced over 4 million more, north and south are finally \non the verge of genuine peace.\n  It is a fragile moment, but one for celebration.\n  Last month, I had the opportunity to meet with Dr. Garang in my \noffice here in Washington. During our meeting, he emphasized to me that \nfor the peace to hold, both parties must fulfill their obligations \nunder the peace agreement signed last January.\n  He also stressed that pressure from the United States is critical. \nThe civil war and its aftermath have created a staggering humanitarian \ncrisis. And he is not confident the government in Khartoum will fulfill \nall of its obligations under the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. Dr. \nGarang firmly believes that U.S. and international sanctions are \nnecessary to keep the process moving forward.\n  During our meeting, he also told me that we can help him sell the \npeace to the Sudanese people. Our assistance in education, health care, \nand roads, for example, can help show a traumatized Nation the benefits \nof peace over continued violence.\n  The road forward will not be easy. Millions have lost their lives in \n20 years of struggle. But the days, weeks and months ahead hold great \npromise not only for the north and south, but for the entire country.\n  Nowhere is that hope more needed than in the western region of Darfur\n  For 2 years, the Sudanese Government has waged a brutal genocide \nagainst the Darfur people. Despite United Nations Security Council \nresolutions, and pressure from the international community and \nneighboring countries, the Government of Khartoum continues to kill and \nmaim.\n  Up to 180,000 innocent victims have died as a result of the \ngovernment-sponsored violence. Two million more have been displaced. \nEntire villages have been burned to the ground.\n  Last November, the Khartoum Government agreed to halt the attacks. \nBut within hours of the agreement, Sudanese police raided a camp in \nsouthern Darfur, destroying homes and driving out civilians.\n  I have visited the region and have heard the stories first hand.\n  Last August, I visited a refugee camp called Touloum in Chad. \nThousands of refugees are housed in dust-covered tents. Many more live \nin make-shift shelters of gathered wood and plastic sheeting.\n  I met with refugees and community leaders. Their testimonials were \nsearing.\n  I heard the story of a mentally disabled 15-year-old boy being thrown \ninto a burning house, and of an old, paralyzed man burned alive in his \nhut.\n  I heard stories of women raped in front of their own children, and \nmale villagers being summarily executed.\n  I asked one refugee in Touloum what it would take for him to go home. \nHe said, ``I'll go if you come with me and stay with me.''\n  Last week, the Government of Sudan and the rebels in Darfur signed a \nDeclaration of Principles for the Resolution of the Sudanese Conflict \nin Darfur. This agreement provides a framework for negotiations.\n  In order for it to work, however, all parties must stop the violence \nnow. The conflict will only be resolved through peaceful negotiations \nand dialogue.\n  The United Nations has taken limited steps to punish those \nresponsible for the atrocities. In March, the U.N. Security Council \nvoted to freeze the assets of individuals deemed guilty of committing \nwar crimes or breaking cease-fire agreements. It also voted to ban \nthese individuals from traveling.\n  In addition, the Security Council voted to forbid the Sudanese \nGovernment from carrying out offensive military flights over Darfur, \nand from sending military equipment into the\n\n\nregion without first notifying the Council.\n  The introduction of troops into Darfur from the African Union is a \npositive development. There are currently 2,400 African Union troops in \nDarfur. By August, that number should go up to 7,700 and by next spring \n12,300. NATO has also agreed to provide logistical support to the \nAfrican Union peacekeepers in Darfur.\n  These are hopeful and helpful measures. But more must be done. The \nviolence will continue to escalate and the death toll will rise unless, \nand until, the international community takes stronger action against \nKhartoum.\n  The world's leaders need to impose more comprehensive sanctions on \nthe Sudanese Government, including on its oil industry. Tough and \nintense pressure must be brought to bear.\n  The progress between the south of Sudan and Khartoum is promising and \nshould guide the way forward in Darfur.\n  But time is running out. We cannot ``wait and see.'' The Darfur \npeople need our help. They are crying out for support. We must act, \nnow, before it is too late and their voices fade to silence.\n\n\n                                  cuba\n\n  Today, we have an opportunity to assist the Cuban people in their \nstruggle for liberty. The Foreign Operations bill under consideration \nprovides funding for an airplane to transmit Radio Marti, around the \nclock, providing constant support to those on the island fighting for \nfreedom.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this effort. Radio Marti has been \ncritical in promoting the cause of Cuban liberty.\n  Since its inception 20 years ago, Radio Marti has brought news to and \nfrom the isolated country in defiance of Castro's censors.\n  On May 20, 1985, at 5:30 in the morning, Radio Marti launched its \nfirst broadcast to the Cuban people. Fourteen and a half hours of \nuncensored news reached Cuba from a studio here in Washington, DC, via \ntransmitters in Marathon Key.\n  Named after the Cuban intellectual and patriot, Jose Marti, the \nstation broke through Castro's propaganda machine and offered the Cuban \npeople news, entertainment and discussion with Cuban journalists, \nthinkers, writers and entertainers.\n  In just a few short years, Radio Marti became the most listened to \nstation in Cuba.\n  Many Cuban reporters now send their stories to the U.S.-based station \nto bypass the government and beam directly into Cuban homes. Over the \nyears, dissidents and human rights advocates have come to rely on these \ntransmissions for strength and hope.\n  As President Reagan told an audience back in 1983 while Congress was \ndebating the Radio Broadcasting to Cuba Act, ``there is no more \nimportant foreign policy initiative in this administration, and none \nthat frightens our adversaries more, than our attempts through our \ninternational radios to build constituencies for peace in nations \ndominated by totalitarian, militaristic regimes.''\n  In 1990, TV Marti was launched, bringing in a new wave of free media. \nWithin 23 minutes of its first broadcast, Castro jammed the airwaves, \nbut his success was only temporary.\n  Like its radio companion, TV Marti offers political news and debate. \nIt also airs soap operas and sports.\n  Whether as news or entertainment, these broadcasts help to spark the \nimaginations and aspirations of the Cuban people. They pierce the \nregime's imposed isolation and bring the Cuban people into the world \ncommunity, and the world community to the Cuban people.\n  To this day, the Communist party controls all formal means of mass \ncommunication on the island. It has constructed a complicated apparatus \nof censors and technology to air its propaganda and smother divergent \nviews. All print and electronic media are considered state property \nunder the control of the party. Foreign magazines and newspapers are \noutlawed as subversive material.\n  That is why Radio and TV Marti are so critical. And that is why I \nurge my colleagues to amplify our efforts now.\n  Jose Marti once said that, ``Others looked at radio and saw a gadget; \nhis genius lay in his capacity to look at the same thing, but to see \nfar more.''\n  I urge my colleagues to share the vision held by our former president \nRonald Reagan when he first proposed Radio Marti. The Wall had not yet \nfallen, and millions of people still lived under the boot of the brutal \nCommunist empire.\n  But he knew that Radio Free Europe was reaching and inspiring \nmillions of men and women trapped behind the Iron Curtain, in bleak \nCommunist towns and in dark Communist prisons. And like Radio Free \nEurope, he knew that Radio Marti would reach and lift up those living \nin the Communist island just 90 miles from our southern shores.\n  So, today, I urge my colleagues to continue our support for the \naspirations of the Cuban people.\n  With just one plane and one radio station, we can broadcast the call \nof freedom to millions.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 12, "speaker": "Mr. FRIST", "itemno": 22}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, amendment 1245 is offered on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Craig, and others to focus some time and discussion on \nthe issue of family, of stability, of permanency for children around \nthe world. I couldn't agree more with the Senator from Tennessee when \nhe says this underlying bill, the bill that funds all of our foreign \noperations, assistance to many countries throughout the world, \ncountries that are developing, countries that are well established, \nthat share our values, that one of the most critical components of this \nunderlying bill is to advance American values around the world.\n  We know not every action we take is perfect. We know not every \nthought we have is exactly right. But Americans believe we work hard at \nestablishing good values. We know we are not perfect, but we try to get \nbetter and better each decade and each century. I could not agree more \nwith the Senator from Tennessee when he says this bill in particular is \na bill that helps us to advance our values around the world.\n  One of the values all Americans believe in is the value of family, \nthe importance of family, the importance of the principle that children \nshould in fact be raised in families. Children don't raise themselves. \nGovernments don't raise children; parents raise children. And sometimes \none responsible parent raises a child. That is the way it has been. \nThat is the way we like to see it. It is the way we want to promote it \nhere at home and abroad.\n  Senator Craig and I offer this amendment with others to express the \nsense of Congress regarding the use of the funds in this bill, which \nare substantial in section 3, for orphans and displaced and abandoned \nchildren. This amendment simply says our money in this bill should be \nlaid down by USAID. We are not earmarking any money. We are not adding \nany money. We are not spending any additional money, just the money \nthat is in this bill, that Members have said we want to send out to \ncountries, should recognize the principles of The Hague Convention on \nProtection of Children and Co-Operation in Respect of Intercountry \nAdoption, should recognize the principle that children should stay with \nthe families to which they are born. Our aid, whether it is for \neconomic development or for education or health, should recognize the \ndignity and respect of each individual family unit. Try to keep \nchildren who are born to a family connected to that family.\n  Sometimes we know that doesn't happen or, unfortunately, it can't \nhappen. War, disease, famine, violence separate children from their \nnatural parents. When that happens, it is the principles of the United \nStates, the values of the United States that we proudly share with the \nworld to say that child who is orphaned should not be left alone to \nraise themselves. That child should be placed with a loving, caring, \nresponsible relative as quickly as possible, someone in the extended \nfamily.\n\n\nIt could be the grandmother, grandfather, responsible aunt or uncle, \nperhaps an older sibling, not 12 years old, not 13 years old, but a 20-\nyear-old or a 30-year-old, to raise that child and then that family \nunit continues.\n  When there is no a responsible adult in that family, then our \nprinciples say we should then look for some other family, perhaps a \nneighbor, another family in the community, a friend of the family to \ntake that child or those children in and raise them and try to instill \ngood values and security and happiness for that child's harmonious \ndevelopment.\n  If there is no family to be found within the neighborhood, the \nvillage, the community, then we should, as a human family, find some \nfamily in the world to take in that child. It is the miracle of \nadoption that is occurring all over this country and all over the \nworld.\n  My husband and I have adopted children. We are very proud of our \nwonderful children. Many Members of Congress have added to their \nfamilies or created their families through adoption. It is becoming \nsomething that Americans understand and believe to be important. There \nshould not be any orphaned children, any waiting children. They are \njust unfound families, and we need to do a better job of connecting \nchildren who need homes with loving parents who will give them that \nsupport.\n  I come to this issue not just from a personal perspective but even \nbefore we went through this miracle of adoption ourselves, I understood \nthis to be the truth. Children can't raise themselves. I was raised in \na home, the eldest of nine children, with two loving parents. Many of \nus had wonderful experiences as we were growing up. We understand the \nvalue of keeping children protected and nurtured in the family setting. \nWe come to this floor all the time trying to stop child trafficking, \nstop child abuse, mental illness, promote special education. The best \nway to stop some of that is to connect children with responsible adults \nwho will raise them. It saves the taxpayers a lot of money, saves a lot \nof pain, saves a lot of anguish. That is what Americans, whether they \nare Republican, Independent, or Democrat, believe in. That is one thing \nI am confident of and need no poll to tell me.\n  I am a little surprised that when we laid down this amendment, we \nthought it would be accepted without any discussion, but there \nevidently is some hesitation. There is some sense that USAID doesn't \nagree with that. I am interested. If some Senator would like to explain \nUSAID's position that they don't think families are important, I think \nthe Congress would love to hear that. It would be quite a surprise to \nthose of us who are appropriators who fund USAID and actually believe \nin so much of what they are doing, that they have a problem with an \namendment that simply says children belong in families. That is all \nthis amendment says.\n  Last year Americans adopted 120,000 children. Twenty thousand \nchildren came from many countries around the world to find a happy home \nhere in America. One hundred thousand children were adopted, half of \nthem out of our own foster care system which we recognize has some \nstrengths but some weaknesses. We are working on that. We admit our \nlong-term foster care has kept children in limbo for far too long. It \nhas been a barrier, sometimes, to appropriate reunification. It most \ncertainly has been a barrier to adoption.\n  Senators such as Senators Rockefeller, DeWine, Clinton, and others \nhave spent many years working to reform that system. We are making a \nlot of headway. We are proud of it. But we had over 50,000 children \nadopted out of foster care.\n  Two children visited my office yesterday. They were 12 and 10, \nprecious little boys from Louisiana. They said: Senator, we want you to \nmeet our new mom. We were just adopted.\n  I asked the mom: Could I please speak to the children privately for a \nfew moments?\n  She said: Fine.\n  So I had the little children in my office. I said: You don't have to \ntell me any of the details. I know it has been difficult. I just want \nto know, are you OK, are you happy?\n  They said: Senator, we are very happy with our new mom. She was our \nfoster mom for a number of years. She is doing her best. Our parents \njust haven't been around.\n  I didn't want to go into too much detail with the children. But their \nlittle eyes were so hopeful. I walked out and I said: Congratulations. \nThese two children now have a loving adult mother who is going to raise \nthem and give them a future that they didn't have in the first years of \ntheir life.\n  I thank the Senators for all of their work and what they have done in \nthat regard. We are making a lot of progress in our Nation. So this \namendment basically recognizes that and says that we believe we should \ndo everything we can to keep children in the family to which they are \nborn. But when that separation happens, through all the things that I \nsaid about what can cause it, we need then to establish a permanent \nplan for children that tries to place them in another family as quickly \nas possible. Domestic adoption first. But if there are no families \nwilling to adopt in that community or country, then intercountry \nadoption into the human family becomes very important before \norphanages, institutions, et cetera.\n  So that is what this amendment does. It lifts our values that the \nSenator from Tennessee spoke about, lifts language from laws we have \nalready passed in overwhelming numbers on this Senate floor, and it \nsays in this amendment that all of the money in section 3 should \nrecognize these principles.\n  There are over 54 countries in the world that have basically signed \nand ratified and are in the process of implementing these principles \nthat are in the Landrieu-Craig amendment. This amendment says that \nsometimes temporary refugee camps are necessary, where children are \ntemporarily separated because of war. But when the permanency plans \nbegin to be made, let's make sure we put domestic adoption and \nintercountry adoption before long-term institutional care or, for that \nmatter, letting children out on the streets to raise themselves. It is \nvery clear.\n  So I say, again, that I hope we can get a strong, bipartisan vote on \nthis amendment. I am sorry that there has been any difficulty. It was \nnot meant to be that way. But I felt this issue had to be clarified in \nthe bill because I was hearing too much at hearings, seeing too many \nthings in letters that were passed on some of these issues that it gave \nme pause to think, I wonder if the USAID position is truly reflecting \nthe position of the Congress, of the current Bush administration, of \nthe State Department, which is the stated policy in support of the idea \nthat children belong in families.\n  So I am hoping that with the cosponsors we have on this amendment we \nwill get a strong vote affirming that intercountry adoption may offer \nadvantages of a permanent family to a child or children for whom a \nfamily cannot be found in the child's home country. Let me state again:\n\n       Affirms that intercountry adoption may offer advantages of \n     a permanent family to a child for whom a family cannot be \n     found in the child's state of origin.\n\n  That seems to be controversial language. I cannot see it.\n  No. 4:\n\n       Affirms that long-term foster care or institutionalization \n     are not permanent options and should, therefore, only be used \n     when no other permanent option is available.\n\n  That is clear. We want to try to find a child a home, a real family. \nAnd there are 40 million orphans in the world, so this is not an easy \ntask. But it is doable if we all work at it. If we cannot find children \na home, if we have worked hard to look for a home for somebody that \nwould take them in their own country, and we look internationally and \ntry to find a family that would take them in, and we cannot find that, \nthen, of course, we can have long-term institutions and foster care as \nthe last and final option.\n  Please, let's give children a chance. In New Orleans right now--I had \npictures sent to me--14 little orphans from Russia, between the ages of \n5 and 12, through a program that many of us support, came over to the \nUnited States and spent 6 weeks in New Orleans. You know what the great \nnews is? Yesterday, 12 of those 14 children are going to find permanent \nhomes here. These children are older, but they are not damaged goods. \nJust because they are not little 3-month-old infants or 6-\n\n\nmonth-old infants, they have a bright future. God gave them a lot of \ntalent. They are stuck in an orphanage, where they have very little \nhope and opportunity. At the age of 15, they will be turned out on the \nstreet to fend for themselves.\n  If you want to talk about child prostitution or trafficking or what \nhappens to children when they leave an orphanage at age 15, with no \nparents, no means of support, and no education--this amendment cuts \ndown on child trafficking. This amendment cuts down on child \nexploitation. This amendment cuts down on child prostitution. If you \ncan connect a child to an adult that will protect a child, that is the \nparents' primary job, protecting our children, and most parents do that \nvery well.\n  For me to stand on the Senate floor and have to argue this to the \nagency that is sending out money around the world because they think \nthis is not what other cultures are about--I am not an expert. I am a \nsociology major, but I never read where a family is not the primary \nbuilding block of the community. If anybody knows of any other culture \nthat doesn't recognize the family, let me know because in all of my \nreading, I have never read that anywhere. In every culture, family is \nimportant. We might describe it a little differently, and we may have \ndifferent views about what a family looks like, which is not the \nsubject of this amendment, but I don't know any culture anywhere in the \nworld that doesn't think family is important.\n  So when USAID stands there and tells me something such as, it is not \nreally in other cultures that this is important, I say, hogwash. \nFamilies are important. We define them differently. We respect the \ndifferent views of how families come together. But in every culture \nadults raise children, and that is all this amendment says. It says, as \na last resort, when you cannot find a family for a child--when you have \ntried and cannot find a family--then go ahead and build your \norphanages, your institutions, and I hope that they will build them in \na way and staff them in a way that these children know that, despite \nthe fact they don't have a mother, father or someone to love them, they \ncan be raised with a skill so that they can find their way. It is \ndifficult when you are on your own. Children have done it before, and \nthey will do it again. But for heaven's sake, can we try to find them a \nfamily?\n  Senator Craig and I offered this amendment. We cochair the commission \non adoption. We have 180 Members of Congress who feel very strongly \nabout this issue. I don't think we should be debating it, but for some \nreason we are. Our Members are Republicans and Democrats. None of our \nMembers can understand why we are having this discussion, but here we \nare.\n\n  So this amendment simply, again, reaffirms its commitment to the \nfounding principles of the Hague convention on the protection of \nchildren, recognizing that each country should take, as a matter of \npriority, every appropriate measure to enable a child to remain in the \ncare of the child's family of origin. But when that is not possible, \nthey should strive to place the child in a permanent and loving home \nthrough adoption. It affirms that intercountry adoption may offer the \nadvantage of a permanent family to a child for whom a family cannot be \nfound in the child's country. It affirms that long-term foster care or \ninstitutionalization are not permanent options and should, therefore, \nonly be used when no other permanent option is available. It recognizes \nthat programs that protect and support families can reduce the \nabandonment and exploitation of children.\n  I congratulate President Bush and his administration for agreeing to \na breakthrough amendment with the country of Vietnam recently to open \nup again international adoption. There were some corruption issues. \nThere was some lack of transparency in the process. There was some \nconcern that this was not operating as smoothly as it should. So it was \ntemporarily suspended. But because of the good work of the President \nand the President's administration, that was basically recreated. I \nhave a copy of the agreement.\n  When an agency such as USAID tells me; ``We like what you are saying, \nbut it is not our policy,'' I am confused because the President of the \nUnited States signed an agreement with Vietnam that has the same \nlanguage of The Hague, in the first paragraph of this document: \nAgreement between the United States and the Socialist Republic of \nVietnam. Clause 1, clause 2, and clause 3 are exactly this amendment. \nForty-one Members of the Senate and the Congress signed a letter to the \nPresident of Romania outlining this exact principle. So the 41 Members \nwho signed this letter, and myself, are very confused as to why this \namendment is a problem. Again, I offered it to clarify.\n  This will be a great clarification to USAID that, unequivocally, the \nMembers of this body and the House of Representatives, when this is \npassed, say that we value families; we think children should be in \nfamilies; we want to do everything we can to connect children to \nfamilies; we think they should stay in the families to which they are \nwere born but, if not, find one close to home and, if not, someplace in \nthe human family for them. End of story.\n  If that all fails, go ahead and build your orphanages and \ninstitutions. I don't know of anybody who grew up in an orphanage that \nliked it--not one person. I don't know anybody alive that ever told me \nthat they had a happy time growing up in an orphanage. That is not a \nvalue that Americans believe in. I have had lots of people tell me they \nwere so happy to grow up in a loving family. I have had people cry to \nme and say: I spent time in an orphanage my whole life. Nobody ever \ncame for me, Senator. I have had people tell me that. I have never had \nanybody say to me how happy they were to grow up in a refugee camp or \nan orphanage.\n  I am not spending a penny in this bill to promote the idea that \nchildren could be happy being raised in an orphanage when one caregiver \ncomes in for 300 children. I have been in a lot of these orphanages. \nSome of our other members have been also. I have traveled all over the \nworld to some of these orphanage. I cannot describe the horrors of what \nI have seen. I cannot sit here on the floor of the Senate and let this \ngo through being a little unclear. This is very clear to me, and it \nshould be very clear to the Members of this body.\n  I know we are going to vote at 2 o'clock. I appreciate my colleagues \ngiving me this time to express myself. I obviously feel strongly about \nit. Many Senators and House Members feel strongly about this. We are \ndoing this here in the United States. This is our policy. So we need to \npromote, as Senator Frist said, our values--not force them, but promote \nthem. Nothing is being forced here. We are promoting and saying, these \nare our values. We believe family is important. We are giving plenty of \nroom in this amendment. We understand that there might be some \ncontingency plans that have to be made, but let's try to connect \nchildren to families. I think it is the least we can do. I wanted to \nclarify that this is a value of the people of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum", "turn": 18, "speaker": "Ms. LANDRIEU", "itemno": 29}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nadd just a few more items for the record on the subject about which I \nwas just speaking, which is the Landrieu-Craig amendment on \ninternational adoption, domestic adoption, and family preservation.\n  One of the items that got my attention which prompted the offering of \nthis amendment was a National Public Radio commentary, which I want to \nsubmit for the Record, after the tsunami disaster. I had the \nopportunity to visit the region affected with the Senator from \nTennessee. I spent 3 days on the ground reviewing the damage in Sri \nLanka and all over the devastated area.\n  This is what prompted this amendment, when we were focused on the \nissue of these children having been displaced. Of course, we remember \nthe devastation that occurred. Children were tragically separated from \ntheir families. There was great interest in the children who might have \nbeen orphaned in that disaster and whether they could find a home \nelsewhere.\n\n\n  There was a great coalition of people in the United States and around \nthe world who felt strongly about that. We began working on it and \nencouraging that children who had been orphaned, whose parents had been \nswept out to sea, the children who survived, of trying to place them \nwith relatives, along the lines of what I have been speaking.\n  Then there was this NPR commentary, and I would like to read a \nparagraph of it into the Record:\n\n       Jaco spends his days--\n\nThis is a UNICEF worker funded in part by USAID--\n\n     walking through refugee camps, trying to find orphans. He's \n     not from Aceh; he's a social worker from nearby Medan who \n     came here as part of--\n\n  The Government's efforts at a child welfare program that is working \nwith UNICEF to care for children who have lost their parents.\n  This worker is walking through this refugee camp, and he finds an \norphan, according to NPR, and he finds the orphan's aunt. He says to \nthe aunt: We would like to take this child to one of the Islamic \nboarding schools.\n  The aunt says: No, I would like to help raise this child.\n  The worker then is in a discussion trying to convince the aunt to let \nthe orphan be raised in a boarding school.\n  This is what started this whole amendment. I know one cannot believe \neverything one reads in the newspapers, and one cannot believe \neverything one hears on the radio, but when we investigated this and \nlooked into it, we found that this, in fact, was a pattern that was \noccurring; that our money was being used to fund workers who, instead \nof being so happy that they found an aunt for this child and saying, \n``We have a program that can help; we know it is difficult; you are \nprobably raising three or four other children; we are appreciative that \nyou are taking in this orphan,'' our money was being used to promote \nsomething completely contrary to our views and policies, which is: Oh, \ndon't worry, let the government take this child and raise it in a \nboarding school.\n  Whether it was a Christian boarding school, Islamic boarding school, \nMuslim boarding school, the Christian, Muslim, or Islamic boarding \nschools are not the same as being raised in a Christian, Muslim, \nIslamic family. That is the point.\n  What happens is, if we don't make this clear, it will end up that \nmoney is going to support orphanages and discouraging the reunification \nof orphans with their families.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record this commentary by \nNational Public Radio which has prompted this whole initiative, if \nanyone has questions about it.", "turn": 22, "speaker": "Ms. LANDRIEU", "itemno": 34}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in ", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 35}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "the Record, as follows:\n\n   Analysis: Indonesian Government Bans Adoptions of Tsunami Orphans\n\n       Steve Inskeep, host: Indonesian authorities are trying to \n     provide security to some of the most vulnerable victims of \n     last month's tsunami. In the province of Aceh, an estimated \n     35,000 children were orphaned or separated from their \n     parents. The government has temporarily outlawed adoption in \n     that province.

She grabbed \n     the little girl and now considers her her own daughter. Jaco \n     writes down Suryani's information--name, age, parents' name, \n     home village--and then tells Harati that it will be very \n     difficult for her to care for Suryani, since they no longer \n     have a house or any possessions.\n       Jaco: (Foreign language spoken)\n       Davidson: He says she should send Suryani to one of the new \n     Islamic boarding schools that will open soon. The girl will \n     be well cared for, and the family can visit on weekends. \n     Harati thanks Jaco and smiles. When Jaco leaves, she says \n     that she's not sending Suryani anywhere. She'll take care of \n     the girl on her own. Jaco is sympathetic, but thinks Harati \n     is wrong.\n       Jaco: (Through Translator) If we think psychologically it's \n     normal if their family would like to take the orphans then, \n     but if we think logically, right now they don't need only \n     being with the family but they need food, they need \n     education, they need therapy from the psychologists to make \n     their life normal again.\n       Davidson: Jaco and his small team have identified 56 \n     orphans so far, 20 in this camp alone. There are dozens of \n     children here, most of them with their parents. Pusaka \n     Indonesia, the child advocacy group, has set up a special \n     children's area in the corner of the camp. There's a host of \n     teachers and social workers who watch over the kids. Vivi \n     Sofianti is a child psychologist. She leads them in games and \n     songs.\n       Davidson: She says they stop being depressed when they \n     sing.\n       Ms. Vivi Sofianti (Child Psychologist): (Through \n     Translator) What I've learned from them right now, they \n     really need entertainment to forget their--what will happen \n     to them.\n       Lucman(ph) (Tsunami Survivor): (Foreign language spoken)\n       Davidson: Lucman, 45, walks up to a table under a canopy \n     next to the children's area. He's looking for his 15-year-old \n     son, Maludin(ph), and his nine-year-old daughter, \n     Safrida(ph). He hasn't seen them since the tsunami destroyed \n     their neighborhood, Pulanga Han(ph), in downtown Banda Aceh. \n     Lucman spent the last two weeks searching for them in dozens \n     of refugee camps. A Pusaka Indonesia worker takes down the \n     children's information. All the data is entered into a \n     database in two computers next to the desk. There's a list of \n     hundreds of parents and dozens of children. The goal is to \n     link the children Jaco and his team find with the parents who \n     are searching for their own. Deni Purba runs the operation.\n       Mr. Deni Purba (Aid Worker): I believe half of them will \n     find their relatives. That's why we are here.\n       Davidson: There are similar programs all over Aceh \n     province. But in the end, Purba believes, thousands of \n     children will be left with no relatives at all. He says it \n     will be up to the Indonesian government to decide what to do \n     with those who are alone. But, Purba says, the best solution \n     is the one the government is planning, to send all the \n     orphans to boarding schools.\n       Davidson: Adoption wouldn't work.\n       Mr. Purba: No, we don't support adoption, because is not \n     Acehenese culture.\n       Davidson: There are rumors of child sex traffickers \n     prowling for orphans. There are stories of foreigners buying \n     Acehenese children. Purba says the children have suffered \n     enough trauma and should be kept here, where people speak \n     their language and know their culture, and where the orphans \n     can help each other adjust to a new kind of life.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1242\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 36}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000550", "text": "  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, yesterday, there were several amendments \nvoted on and, unfortunately, I was not here yesterday. I was attending \na funeral of one of our State officials who unexpectedly passed away. \nHad I been here, I would have voted with my colleagues in rejecting the \nCoburn-Boxer amendment to the fiscal year 2006 State and Foreign \nOperations appropriations bill, which is the bill about which I am \nspeaking.\n  Mr. President, while the vote on this amendment was taking place, as \nI said, I was returning from the funeral of my dear friend and \nLouisiana Secretary of State, the Honorable Fox McKeithen. Had I been \nhere, I would have voted with my colleagues in rejecting the Coburn-\nBoxer amendment to the fiscal year 2006 State and Foreign Operations \nappropriations bill.\n  In preparation for this vote, I cosigned a letter, along with my \ncolleagues Senators Feinstein, Santorum, and Specter requesting that \nSenators vote against the amendment. I have concluded this amendment \nwould derail something that would benefit both China and the United \nStates at a critical time in our two nations' history.\n  In this, the most important bilateral relationship of the 21st \ncentury, it is crucial that both countries continue to work in \ncooperation with one another.\n  The Shaw Group-Westinghouse consortium is the only American team \nbidding on a contract to construct four advanced-designed nuclear \npowerplants in China.\n  This deal has the full support of the U.S. Department of Energy which \nhas authorized that the Shaw Group and Westinghouse Consortium work in \nthe\n\n\nPeople's Republic of China, PRC. The National Nuclear Security \nAdministration, NNSA, has thoroughly reviewed the proposal and \ndetermined that concerns over national security are negligible.\n  Nuclear safety and technology transfer are key national security \nissues that nobody takes lightly. After much deliberation and \nconsideration of these sensitive issues, it is clear that this deal is \ngood for both the United States and China.\n  The AP1000 advanced design nuclear reactor is one of the safest \nnuclear reactors in the world and is on the cutting edge of nuclear \ntechnological innovation. This innovation will yield significant \neconomic and environmental benefits.\n  This proposal would support a significant number of high value U.S. \nexport oriented jobs in the manufacturing and engineering services \nareas.\n  At a time when Americans are concerned about their jobs, we should \ndemonstrate through initiatives such as this that we have their \neconomic best interests at heart.\n  The Shaw-Westinghouse Consortium benefits small businesses by virtue \nof the many U.S. subcontractors that will be used during the \nimplementation phase of this contract.\n  The Consortium's bid would create or sustain more than 5,000 high-\ntech U.S. jobs, and provide ongoing jobs for many years to come, not \njust for the China project, but for sales in the United States and \nother global markets\n  This proposal seeks to address not only jobs, but the tremendous \ntrade imbalance between the United States and China.\n  The U.S. Export-Import Bank exists to provide financing of last \nresort to assist exporters in order to create jobs and export growth \nfor the U.S. economy.\n  This deal would be consistent with the 1985 Agreement for Cooperation \nBetween the Government of the United States of America and the \nGovernment of the People's Republic of China Concerning Peaceful Uses \nof Nuclear Energy.\n  To limit the purchasing of U.S. civilian nuclear energy technology to \nthe Chinese would be disastrous to our bilateral relations at a time \nwhen we must engage the Chinese and to cloak this proposal in anti-\nChinese rhetoric is doing a disservice to the American people.\n  These exports to China will most assuredly yield significant benefits \nto companies and workers in the United States and assist in the \npromotion of the safe, reliable, and efficient growth of nuclear power \nin China, something which will be essential to both countries.\n  The chief competitor is AREVA, a French company. AREVA will have the \nfull support of the French equivalent of the Export-Import Bank, \nCOFACE.\n  If this amendment is passed it will not punish China, but reward the \nFrench and other European economies and exporters who will clearly \nprevail should the Shaw/Westinghouse consortium be denied competitive \nfinancing.\n  This is precisely the sort of investment our country should make to \nensure that we continue to create and sustain high-tech industrial jobs \nin the United States and the continued growth of the nuclear power \nindustry, which will assist as we seek more self-reliance in the energy \nsector of the economy.\n  In no way will the taxpayers be fleeced by this project. The loans \nassociated with the Chinese nuclear power project are made to Chinese \ncustomers and are guaranteed by the Government of China.\n  The taxpayers are not subsidizing these loans and are not at risk \naccording to major credit agencies who evaluate sovereign risk. In \naddition, the Export-Import Bank of the United States charges an \nexposure fee commensurate to the credit risk being taken. For over a \nhalf century the Ex-Im Bank has supported equipment and services for \nnuclear power projects in China.\n  If we do not proceed with caution, the threats of anti-Chinese \nsentiment will tarnish a productive bilateral dialog for every issue \nthat emerges with China.\n  The Shaw Group-Westinghouse Consortium has a sterling reputation and \na distinct advantage with its cutting edge technology. If this deal \nwould have been thwarted in the Senate, it is the United States that \nwould have been punished, not the Chinese.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 23, "speaker": "Ms. LANDRIEU", "itemno": 37}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski).

Madam President, as we all know, last night the President \nof the United States announced the nomination of Judge John Roberts to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. The President noted in his remarks that one of \nthe most consequential decisions a President makes is his nomination of \na Justice to our Nation's highest Court. By nominating Judge Roberts, I \nbelieve the President has met the challenge. I commend him for choosing \na thoroughly accomplished jurist and attorney to rise to this country's \nhighest Court.\n  I point out that the selection process the White House and the \nPresident went through was thorough and, indeed, viewed as \nsatisfactory--in fact, praised significantly by Members on both sides \nof the aisle. The President and his staff consulted with more than 70 \nMembers of the Senate. The President reviewed the credentials of many \nwell-qualified candidates, and the President also met with a number of \npotential nominees.\n  I believe the consultation part of the advise and consent process we \ngo through was more than met by the President and his staff. The \nprocess has resulted in a nominee who truly stands on his achievement.\n  Presidents can and sometimes have nominated Justices for political \nreasons alone. However, this President has done something truly \npraiseworthy in nominating Judge Roberts. He focused on the merits and \npicked a distinguished attorney with a keen legal mind and an \nimpressive record of accomplishment.\n  I think all of us are aware of Judge Roberts' academic background. We \nare aware of his clerking for Justice William Rehnquist, his service in \nthe Department of Justice and, very importantly, being a member of the \nsmall group of lawyers who have practiced before the Supreme Court. In \nfact, Judge Roberts has appeared before and argued cases before the \nU.S. Supreme Court some 39 times. The process has been followed and has \nresulted in an outstanding nominee.\n  There are questions about whether Judge Roberts will answer questions \nconcerning specific issues. I think that issue was put to rest in the \nBreyer and Ginsburg nominations where, appropriately, they did not \nanswer questions that would relate to cases that would be argued before \nthe U.S. Supreme Court.\n  There may be some question about whether Judge Roberts is \nconservative. I think the President of the United States made it very \nclear in the last campaign, and I personally heard him state on \nnumerous occasions, that he would appoint as a Supreme Court Justice, \nin the event of a vacancy, a person who strictly interpreted the \nConstitution of the United States. So just as in the previous \nadministration President Clinton appointed judges such as Justices \nBreyer and Ginsburg who would be viewed by some as liberal, so I think \nit is entirely appropriate that Justice Roberts be viewed as \n``conservative,'' if conservative means someone who strictly interprets \nthe Constitution of the United States in making these incredibly \nimportant decisions that are made by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  As is well known, I am a card-carrying member of the Gang of 14. One \nof the criteria of the Gang of 14 is that we would not filibuster a \nnominee to a court or the Supreme Court unless it was under \n``extraordinary circumstances.'' I do not speak for the other Members. \nEach of those Members speaks for himself or herself. I do believe--at \nleast in my opinion, I am convinced--that even though various Members \nof the Senate on the other side of the aisle may oppose and vote \nagainst Justice Roberts' nomination, and perhaps for well-founded \nreasons, that by no means, by any stretch of the imagination, would \nJustice Roberts, because of his credentials, because of his service, \nbecause of his extraordinary qualifications, meet the extraordinary \ncircumstances criteria.\n  Again, I only speak for myself, but having been in on those \nnegotiations about extraordinary circumstances for hundreds of hours, I \nbelieve Judge Roberts deserves an up-or-down vote, and I hope the other \nmembers of that group would also agree with me.\n  So I think this is a good day for America. We start a process which \nwe should complete by the first week in October so that Justice Roberts \ncan sit in the fall session of the U.S. Supreme Court. I think many of \nus watching him on television last night as he stated his profound \nappreciation for the role of the U.S. Supreme Court in our \nconstitutional democracy, as well as his deep regard for the Court as \nan institution--this is without a doubt a man who is not only fit to \nface the magnitude of the task before him but who has the temperament \nand the judgment to understand the seriousness of his possible service \nas a member of our Nation's highest Court.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 39, "speaker": "Mr. McCAIN", "itemno": 57}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I add my voice of support to the \nPresident's decision to nominate Judge John G. Roberts to the U.S. \nSupreme Court. The process of selecting the next Associate Justice \nshould reflect the best of the American judiciary and not the worst of \nAmerican politics. From the President, the American people deserve a \nSupreme Court nominee who reveres the law. From the Senate, the \nAmerican people deserve a confirmation process that is civil, \ndignified, respectful, and one that does its dead level best to keep \npolitics out of the process.\n  Yesterday, President Bush did his part by announcing the nomination \nof Judge Roberts, and now it is up to us in the Senate to do our part \nto ensure that the process for confirming this nomination does honor to \nthe Supreme Court, to the Senate, and to the Nation.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States is one of our Nation's most \ncherished institutions. It is also our Nation's most powerful symbol of \nour commitment to constitutional democracy and the rule of law. We need \nmen and women who serve on that Court who meet the highest standards of \nintegrity, intellect, and character. Most important, we need men and \nwomen who are committed to the principle that the duty of unelected \njudges in a democracy is to apply the law as written by the people's \nrepresentatives and not to make the law up as they go along.\n  By every indication, Judge Roberts fits this description of what I \nwould consider to be an ideal nominee. Judge Roberts was educated at \nHarvard College and Harvard Law School. Before he became a judge on the \nDistrict of Columbia Court of Appeals in 2003, he was widely regarded \nas one of the most outstanding advocates practicing before the U.S. \nSupreme Court. He has argued dozens of cases before the Court, both as \na lawyer in private practice in Washington and as a public servant.\n\n\n  Over the years, he has held a wide variety of positions with the \nDepartment of Justice, including Principal Deputy Solicitor General, \nthe Federal Government's second highest ranking lawyer before the U.S. \nSupreme Court. With these credentials, it is not surprising that we \nconfirmed this nominee to the Court of Appeals by unanimous consent \njust 2 years ago.\n  Although Judge Roberts has been on the bench only since 2003, his \ndistinguished legal career leaves no doubt that he is extraordinarily \nwell qualified for the Supreme Court. It bears remembering that Chief \nJustice Rehnquist had never served as a judge before he was nominated \nto the Court. Similarly, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who Justice \nRoberts will be succeeding if confirmed, had served only briefly as a \nState court judge before she was elevated to the Supreme Court. As \nSenator Leahy, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nsaid at her confirmation hearing, although:\n\n      . . . her tenure on the appellate bench has not been long in \n     years . . . we should realize that only 60 of the 101 \n     Justices sitting now or in the past have had any prior \n     judicial experience. Only 41 of these have had more than 5 \n     years of service when confirmed, and among those who had no \n     prior experience when confirmed to the United States Supreme \n     Court were included John Marshall and Joseph Story.\n\n  As you know, Justices Marshall and Story were two of the most \ndistinguished Justices who ever served on the Supreme Court and, \nindeed, in our Nation's history. Although the number cited by Senator \nLeahy has changed some over the years since Justice O'Connor was \nconfirmed, his point still stands. One does not need to be a career \njurist to serve this Nation with distinction as a Justice of the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  I believe the President has made a commendable decision, nominating \nJudge Roberts. As I stated earlier, the American people deserve from \nthe President a Supreme Court nominee who reveres the law. From all \nreports, that is exactly what the American people received yesterday. \nFrom the Senate, the American people deserve a confirmation process \nthat is civil, dignified, and respectful, and one that keeps politics \nout of the judiciary as much as is humanly possible.\n  One of the challenges we face when considering a nominee, and \nparticularly one such as Judge Roberts who has had such a long and \ndistinguished career serving clients, is to understand that his work on \nbehalf of his clients does not necessarily reflect his personal views \nthat may appear on a variety of legal documents likely to come before \nthe Senate. As all of us who have practiced law know, the duty of the \nlawyer is to make sure to make the very best possible argument on \nbehalf of his or her client, regardless of whether the lawyer would \nagree with those arguments in the first instance. Litigants in our \nadversarial system of justice are supposed to be judged by a jury of \ntheir peers, not by their lawyers.\n  I think it very important that we keep this in mind. Just as we would \nnot judge Judge Roberts nor should we judge Judge Roberts by the \npositions he has taken on behalf of clients he has represented, we \nwould not judge a prospective nominee should he or she have practiced, \nlet's say, in the area of criminal law, and have defended people who \nhave been accused of crimes. We would not impute those crimes or that \nposition to the lawyer who is representing them, providing them the \nlegal defense to which they are entitled under our constitutional \nsystem. My argument is we should simply apply that same standard to \nJudge Roberts and any other nominee as well.\n  I think it is also important that we remain aware there are those \noutside of this Chamber who will try to taint this process. Already we \nhave seen those who seem to have had a ``fill in the blank'' press \nreleases, waiting only for the name of the prospective nominee before \nthey send them out into cyberspace and across America and indeed around \nthe world. We know there are those outside these Chambers who will try \nto vilify any nominee in order to exploit this process for political \ngain, including raising money. I can only hope we will not, in this \nbody, the 100 Senators who work here and represent our constituents, be \ntempted by the outside interest groups to engage in the same sort of \nirresponsible rhetoric that is used by too many of them.\n  Let us behave as Senators. Let us do our human best to uphold the \ndignity of this great body. And let us try to uphold the dignity of the \nU.S. Supreme Court and conduct ourselves in a manner worthy of the \nAmerican people. History affords some benchmarks to the Senate for \ndetermining whether the Senate has undertaken a confirmation process \nworthy of the Court and of the American people. There is a right way \nand, unfortunately, a wrong way to debate the merits of a Supreme Court \nnominee.\n  In 1993, as I have observed previously on this floor, President \nClinton nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a distinguished jurist but one \nwith an extensive record of activism in a variety of liberal causes \noutside of the judiciary. The Senate looked past all of that and voted \nto confirm Justice Ginsburg by an overwhelming bipartisan vote. The \nSenate did so because we understood our proper role in the confirmation \nprocess should embody three principles: First, that we should focus our \nattention on judicial qualifications, not personal political \npreferences; second, we should engage in respectful and honest inquiry, \nnot partisan personal attacks; and third, we should apply the same fair \nprocess, confirmation or rejection by majority vote, that has existed \nfor more than 214 years of our Nation's history.\n  Yes, this is an important moment for our country. The nomination of \nany person to the U.S. Supreme Court is a celebration of our \nConstitution and our Nation's commitment to the rule of law. The \nPresident has nominated an impressive individual to serve on our \nNation's highest Court and I look forward, as just one Member of this \nbody, to a dignified, civil, and respectful confirmation process in the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 47, "speaker": "Mr. CORNYN", "itemno": 65}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am glad I am following the comments of \nmy colleague Senator Cornyn because we are both privileged to serve on \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, which will be the first line of inquiry \nin relation to Judge John Roberts, who has been nominated by President \nBush to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I have been in public life for over 20 years and cast over 10,000 \nvotes on so many different topics. If you had asked me what is the most \nimportant vote you have ever cast, it is easy; the most important vote \nyou are ever called on to cast is whether America goes to war, because \nyou know as a result of that vote, if the answer is affirmative, that \nAmericans will lose their lives. You will ask families to give up their \nsons and daughters, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, in the \nname of defending America. So there is nothing more important than that \nvote. It is one of the few times--and I faced it three or four times in \nmy congressional career--when you really do lose sleep. You toss in bed \nat night thinking, What is the right thing to do?\n  I would say that after a vote on war, the second most challenging \nvote is the one we will face in a few weeks right here in the Senate, \nthe selection of an individual to serve on the Supreme Court. Why is it \nso important? I think it is important because we know, America knows, \nthe Supreme Court is a very special institution in our democratic form \nof Government. It may be--in fact I would argue that it is--the single \nmost important institution when it comes to protecting our rights and \nliberties. Across that street--we can see it through the glass door \nhere--is the Supreme Court, with nine individuals who will make \ndecisions on a regular basis that will change the face of America, \nchange the lives of American people. Think about the power you give to \nthat person who serves in the Supreme Court: a lifetime appointment to \nstand in judgment not only of individuals and their causes, but to \nstand in judgment of laws that have been written by past generations \nand to stand in judgment of new laws that come before them with \nconstitutional questions and policy questions. It is a momentous \nresponsibility.\n  Rarely does the Senate have an opportunity to consider a vacancy on \nthe Supreme Court. I have served now for 9\n\n\nyears in the Senate and never cast a vote on a Supreme Court nominee. \nThis is the longest period of time since 1823 when we have not had a \nvacancy on the Supreme Court. Now we do. With the retirement of Justice \nSandra Day O'Connor we have an opportunity to fill this vacancy with a \nperson of quality, someone who will serve our Nation.\n  President Bush has nominated Judge John Roberts of the District Court \nof Appeals. I am familiar with him to a limited extent because he came \nbefore our Senate Judiciary Committee several years ago. I think I \nwould concede, and most would concede, the obvious: He is a very well \nqualified person. This man was summa cum laude at Harvard, editor of \nthe Harvard Law Review, and has had some of the most important \nresponsibilities as Principal Deputy Solicitor General speaking on \nbehalf of the Government of the United States of America. He has worked \nat one of the most prestigious law firms in our country. There is no \nquestion about this man's legal skill--none at all.\n  Nor has there been any serious question of any kind raised about his \nintegrity, his honesty. I have not heard a single word suggesting he \ndoes not have the temperament to be a Federal judge. After all, it is a \nlifetime appointment and those of us who practiced law before Federal \njudges know that sometimes lifetime appointments can go to their heads \nand they become somewhat imperial. That has never been suggested when \nit comes to Judge Roberts.\n  So you say: Senator, if his legal skills are accepted, if he is an \nhonest man, if his temperament is good, why not approve him and get on \nwith it? Because this is the Supreme Court. And because the American \npeople expect us to go through the regular process of asking important \nquestions. What are those questions? I think they come down to these: \nWe need to know whether a nominee such as Judge Roberts is in the \nmainstream of American values; whether he is coming to this position on \nthe Supreme Court with a balanced view, an open mind, the kind of \njudicial outlook on the challenges he faces which will do the Court \nproud and do the Nation proud.\n  What kinds of issues will we talk about? When we come to the \nJudiciary Committee I am sure there will be questions of civil rights. \nIn my lifetime, America has changed dramatically in the field of civil \nrights. I can recall as a youngster seeing evidence of segregation, \neven growing up in East St. Louis, IL--segregated schools, segregated \nswimming pools--in my lifetime. But that changed in the 1960s and we \ndecided as a Nation that it diminished us to discriminate against \npeople because of their race.\n  We have decided since that the same rules should apply in many ways \nto questions of gender equity, whether women should have the same \nopportunity as men. So this whole body of law, this whole movement in \nthe United States on civil rights is a movement we have come to accept \nas part of America. There are some who still resist it, but most \nAmericans believe we are a stronger and better nation when we celebrate \nour diversity. The Supreme Court is the place where key decisions on \ncivil rights will be decided. The rights of minorities, the rights of \nwomen, the rights of those with minority religious beliefs, the rights \nof the disabled--that Court will make those decisions.\n  Isn't it important to know whether Judge Roberts stands in the \nmainstream of values when it comes to our civil rights? I think it is \nessential. It is one of the most important questions.\n  What about the rights of women? They have been debated quite a bit on \nthe floor of the Senate and the House, certainly before the Supreme \nCourt. People point to the case of Roe v. Wade. That is the litmus test \ncase for so many people. But I think it goes much deeper. It isn't just \nthe question of abortion--which is controversial, and many people in \ngood faith feel strongly for and against a woman's right to make that \ndecision. But at the heart of that debate is something even more \nfundamental, the right of privacy. What is it that I should expect as \nan American citizen, that I should guard as my individual right of \nprivacy? What right of privacy does my family have? Where can I draw \nthe line and say the Government cannot cross this line?\n  There have been cases before the Supreme Court that decided that, \nmade those decisions and decided where that line would be drawn. Let me \ntell you of one, because when I tell youngsters--I just had a group of \ncollege students I spoke to here on the Hill. When I tell them the \nstory, I can see they are absolutely amazed, but this is something that \nhappened in recent memory for some. Just a few weeks ago was the 40th \nanniversary of a Supreme Court decision called Griswold v. Connecticut. \nIt was a landmark decision. The nine Justices found in our \nConstitution--which I keep in my desk and Senator Byrd carries with him \nat every waking moment--a concept that is not written in the \nConstitution. Search this Constitution with Robert C. Byrd at your side \nand you will never find the word privacy, but the Supreme Court found \nthe concept of privacy in this Constitution when they considered the \ncase of Griswold v. Connecticut.\n\n  What was that case all about? A little history is worth repeating. At \nthe turn of the last century, the 19th century, there was a man named \nAnthony Comstock. Mr. Comstock came from the State of New York. He had \npassionate convictions when it came to morality. He believed it was \nwrong to have any form of pornography, any form of abortion, and any \nform of birth control. After passing a State law in New York, he was \nelected to Congress, which enacted the Comstock law that said basically \nwe prohibit the dissemination of information even about birth control, \nand then Congress did something more. They gave Anthony Comstock of New \nYork extraordinary powers that no American has today. They made him an \nagent of the U.S. Post Office and gave him the power to investigate and \narrest people who violated the law that was passed in his name.\n  He spent his adult life traveling across the United States trying to \nfind those who were giving people counseling on birth control or \nabortions, and so forth, and prosecuting them under the law in his \nname. Before he died, he said he had filled up 61 different passenger \ntrain cars with all the people he had arrested in the name of his law, \nand it was in that Anthony Comstock tradition that States such as \nConnecticut enacted laws which said no married person can legally go to \na pharmacy and have a prescription filled for birth control pills. In \n1965, no doctor in Connecticut could legally prescribe birth control \npills, and no pharmacist could legally fill the prescription for a \nmarried person. This was the law in Connecticut in 1965. When I tell \nthat to young people today, they say: you have to be kidding. No. That \nwas the law in Connecticut and other States.\n  When the law was challenged, the Supreme Court across the street \nsaid: that is wrong. That is such an intimate, personal, private \ndecision, the Government should stay away from it. And in this \nConstitution, without the express words, they found the concept of \nprivacy, and that concept of privacy 8 years later was part of the \nrationale for Roe v. Wade, that that decision on terminating a \npregnancy was a personal, private family decision and that except under \nextraordinary circumstances the Government should not get involved.\n  So when Judge Roberts comes before us, some have argued that it is \nout of line for us to ask him: what is your position when it comes to \nthe Government and the right of privacy? I think it is fundamental. I \nwant to know what is in his heart and what is in his mind.\n  Does he believe in this concept we have seen enshrined in Supreme \nCourt decisions, or does he believe the Government should infringe on \nprivacy rights?\n  You say, well, Senator, you are pointing to cases that are 40 years \nold, 30 years old. How is that relevant today? Consider the matter of \nTerri Schiavo, the tragedy involving this poor young woman who for 15 \nyears was in this--I do not know if vegetative state is the proper \nword, or comatose state, kept alive by a feeding tube, case after case \nin court as to whether her husband, who said he expressed her will that \nshe didn't want to live under these circumstances, had the right to end \nthis feeding tube, case after case, court after court, squabbles and \narguments within the family--good faith, genuine arguments. And then \nfinally\n\n\nthe day came when all these legal appeals had been exhausted. There was \na movement in Congress to step in, to have the Federal courts and the \nFederal Government step into that hospital room, the room where that \ntragic story of Terri Schiavo was taking place. The argument was made \nin this Chamber and on the floor of the House that the privacy of that \nfamily, this intimate personal decision, should take a back seat to the \nright of the Federal court to insert itself into that room.\n  Think about it. Hundreds and thousands of American families every \nsingle day make that hard decision. They do it hoping they have done \nthe right thing for the poor person who is suffering and for the family \nthat survives. And some argued at that moment, when that doctor and \nthat family has to sit down and make that heart-breaking decision, it \nis time for the Federal court to step in. The right of privacy, a right \nstill unresolved and that will be resolved many times over by the \nperson we put on the Supreme Court.\n  Workers' rights, the right to work in a safe workplace, the right to \nbe paid a fair wage, the right to make certain that if you have paid a \nlifetime into a retirement system and someone tries to take it away, \nyou have a moment in court to stand up for what you have worked for. \nThose decisions course through the Federal courts all the way to the \nSupreme Court, and this nominee and others who are the deciding votes \nmake those decisions.\n  I could go on with all of the agenda the new Supreme Court Justice \nmight face, but I hope in these few moments that I have spoken, you \nunderstand the gravity of this decision.\n  Judge Roberts is 50 years old. If he is a healthy person with a good \nlifespan, he may sit on that Court for a quarter of a century. He may \nbe there 25 or 30 years. We have one chance, only one, to ask questions \nof him, to ask what is in his heart, what are his values, does he \nreflect the mainstream of America.\n\n  Sandra Day O'Connor, when she came to the Court, was befriended and \nsponsored by one of the greats who served in the Senate, Barry \nGoldwater of Arizona. I can remember as a college student, Barry \nGoldwater's race for President of the United States in 1964. He was \nrunning as a genuine conservative and he lost. LBJ beat him handily. \nBut he came back to the Senate, retired, and always maintained his \ndignity and interest in public service. When you look back at his \ncareer, he was more a libertarian than conservative, but he surely \ninspired a lot of people. He wanted Sandra Day O'Connor to serve on the \nSupreme Court. He liked the fact she was so talented. She graduated No. \n3 in her class at Stanford Law School, had a tough time finding a job \nbecause she was a woman, and was elected to the State senate. Senator \nBarry Goldwater thought running for public office was a good thing. I \ndo, too. I think running for public office humbles the exalted and it \nis a good thing when people have that experience. And she became the \nfirst woman to serve on the Supreme Court. Most people said she would \nfollow in the Barry Goldwater conservative tradition, and she did, but \nit was mainstream conservatism. It was the kind of conservatism that \nmany in the Republican Party and even some in the Democratic Party are \nvery comfortable with.\n  Later in her career of 24 years of service you saw the libertarian \nstreak coming out in her opinions. She started standing up for a \nwoman's right to choose. She did not want to eliminate Roe v. Wade. She \nstood up when it came to affirmative action at the University of \nMichigan. She stood up when it came to the rights of prisoners and \ndetainees even in this war on terrorism--sort of unpredictable, but \nclearly demonstrating that she had an open mind even as a mainstream \nconservative.\n  Now, I am resigned to the fact that when President Bush nominates \nsomeone to the Supreme Court, it won't be my choice. I am resigned to \nthe fact that person will be a conservative. But what I am looking for \nand many Democrats are looking for is someone who is a mainstream \nconservative. I want them to hold the basic conservative values but not \ncome to the Court with some movement on their mind, some political \nagenda on their mind. I want them to look at things honestly, with an \nopen mind.\n  I sincerely hope Judge Roberts ends up being one of those people as \nwe consider his nomination. We need to find out basic things about him, \nquestions that were not answered when he stood for confirmation to the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He has the \nintelligence for the job. We will ask him whether he has the \nindependence for the job. He has the credentials for the job. But we \nneed to ask questions about his commitment to the basic freedoms and \nliberties in America. The Senate must determine through this \nconfirmation process whether Judge Roberts is entitled to a lifetime \nposition on the highest Court of the land. I know he avoided some \nanswers in an earlier hearing. I hope he will be open and candid and \nhonest at his next hearing. I do not insist that he agree with me on \nevery issue, but I insist that he be open and honest in his answers so \nwe can understand where he is coming from. The Senate and the American \npeople have a right to know where he stands.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.", "turn": 51, "speaker": "Mr. DURBIN", "itemno": 69}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I think President Bush has hit a \nhome run. Because I was with the Baylor Lady Bears this morning \ncongratulating them on winning the national NCAA women's basketball \nchampionship, I would say he hit a three-pointer from midcourt. I think \nJohn Roberts is exactly what our country expects in quality and \ndemeanor for a person to be elevated to the highest court in our land. \nThe Supreme Court is such an important part of our Constitution, \nunique, really, in the world, that we have a judicial branch with such \nstature as the coequal branch of government along with the President \nand the Congress. For someone to be able to sit on the Supreme Court, \nyou look for a John Roberts, someone who has integrity, temperament for \nthe Court, and you have to have judicial temperament because you are an \narbiter who is going to affect people's lives.\n  Academic achievement. We want our Supreme Court Justices to have the \nfinest legal mind possible, and John Roberts fits that description--\nHarvard, summa cum laude graduate; Harvard Law School, graduated with \nhonors, and respect of his peers. When you have someone such as Walter \nDellinger, who served as Solicitor General under President Bill \nClinton, who told the Judiciary Committee at one point, ``In my view, \nthere is no better appellate advocate than John Roberts,'' I think that \nshows the range of support and respect from his peers John Roberts has. \nHe has experience in a variety of legal fields including, of course, \nserving on the Circuit Court of Appeals, second only to the Supreme \nCourt. But he is also young enough that he will be able to make a \nlasting impression on the Supreme Court. At the age of 50, we know he \nhas many years to serve.\n  Some people have asked me, well, didn't you want a woman? Well, yes, \nof course, I did. Of course, I think diversity is important on the \nSupreme Court. I would like to see another woman. I would like to see a \nHispanic American on the Supreme Court. But I believe first and \nforemost what we want is the very best person, and for this time the \nPresident has chosen John Roberts. I think we should give him our full \nsupport.\n  Yes, the Senate is going to do its due diligence. Yes, we are going \nto meet our responsibilities. We are going to ask questions. We are \ngoing to examine his background. Of course, we are going to look at his \nrecord as an attorney, as a judge. But we also are going to do it with \nintegrity and with a respect for the process. I think Justice \nGinsburg's confirmation process is an example. In fact, President \nClinton's two nominees for the Court took an average of 58 days from \nnomination to confirmation. I think 2 months is an acceptable amount of \ntime to be able to delve into someone's background and career, to be \nable to ask the questions you would expect from the Senate, and I \nthought\n\n\nthat in President Clinton's nominations we gave him deference. As \nSenator Durbin said, just before me, President Bush is not going to \nappoint someone Dick Durbin would appoint. Well, certainly President \nClinton isn't going to appoint someone that I would also nominate. But \nthat wasn't the question. The people of America elected President \nClinton, just as they elected President Bush. So we now need to look at \ntheir nominee, knowing that perhaps the philosophy may not be the same \non the other side of the aisle as it is going to be for President \nBush's nominee. But I want the same deference given to John Roberts I \ngave to Ruth Bader Ginsburg. I looked at her record of integrity, I \nlistened to the people who were for her and against her, and I \ndetermined that for President Clinton this was a nominee who should be \nsupported. She would not meet my litmus test of issues, but she is an \nacademically qualified person of integrity with judicial temperament.\n\n  I hope Judge Roberts receives the same level of support and respect \nthat has been given to Justice Ginsburg by this Senate.\n  President Bush and the White House staff have demonstrated an \nunprecedented level of consultation with Senators. I don't think any \nPresident and his staff have consulted with as many Senators as \nPresident Bush has on this, his first nominee. I was very pleased to be \ncalled and to be able to give names.\n  I admit that John Roberts was one of the names I mentioned in my \nconsultation call as the example of the very great legal mind and \nopportunity he would bring to the Court. He is the kind of person we \nexpect to be appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Everything I have heard so far, both from Democrats and Republicans--\nRepublicans being supportive, Democrats being wait and see, let's look \nat the record, but not negative--is a good thing. John Roberts is going \nto meet every test. He showed when he was at his Senate confirmation \nhearing for his circuit court of appeals appointment that he is really \ngood. He had tough questions. You could see the intelligence coming \nthrough.\n  I know he is a family man. He was with his wife and two precious \nchildren at the hearing he had a couple of years ago and then again \nlast night. He is a family man who will be a role model for children, \nfor our country, and a patriot, a person who wants to be a public \nservant, someone who believes in our country and the role of the \nSupreme Court in our country.\n  This is a man who is going to be confirmed very easily. I hope that \nis the case. I hope the Senate will show how the Senate ought to \noperate with due diligence and, yes, asking questions in a respectful \nway for this very esteemed judge who is being proposed for the Supreme \nCourt by our President.\n  I am proud of our President. He has done a terrific job of looking at \nall of the options and saying he wants one of his legacies to be the \nselection of a great Supreme Court Justice who will serve for a long \ntime. He has made the right choice.\n  I support this nomination. I support the right of the Senate to do \nour responsibility under the Constitution for advice and consent. That \nis going to happen from the early indications I have seen, in the talk \nshows, in the questioning by the media, and also in the Senate. I look \nforward to the next 2 months and seeing this institution do what we \nought to be doing in the right way.\n  I am very proud today to support the nomination of John Roberts to \nthe Supreme Court of the United States.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 56, "speaker": "Mrs. HUTCHISON", "itemno": 74}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee).

Mr. President, we have had some discussion floating \naround this Foreign Operations appropriations bill about the proposed \nCNOOC-Unocal merger. As I understand it, amendments that directly \naffect that merger have been withdrawn. That is not a problem, as far \nas I am concerned, if the sponsors of those amendments on both sides of \nthe aisle wish to delay offering the amendments, to do it on a \ndifferent appropriations bill.\n  My amendment is different. Let me explain.\n  My basic problem with the CNOOC-Unocal merger is not the same as that \nof many of my colleagues.\n  I am not sure it meets the strategic test, and I am willing to leave \nthat to the body that judges that strategic test. I have a different \nproblem. It is a problem that the Senator from South Carolina and I \nhave talked about in terms of currency and other issues; that is, China \ndoesn't play fair. What China thinks is good for China, they don't \nthink is good for American companies. That is true here in terms of \nmergers. CNOOC wishes to buy Unocal, an important company in the United \nStates dealing with a very important commodity--oil--whether it meets \nthe strategic test or not. But if you look at the ability of American \ncompanies to buy Chinese companies in industries that China considers \nstrategic, you will find barriers along the way. At least that is what \nI have found.\n  What is good for the goose is good for the gander. We ought to have \nsome degree of reciprocity. If the Chinese--in this case, the Chinese \nGovernment, since they own 70 percent of CNOOC--wish to buy an American \ncompany, why should they be allowed to block\n\n\nAmerican companies that wish to buy similarly situated Chinese \ncompanies, the American automobile industry, the American construction \nindustry, the American financial services industry? I will be issuing a \nreport shortly which shows that in these strategic industries, American \nfirms have barriers placed in their way. All of them meet approval. Yet \nin instance after instance, the American company cannot buy a majority \nshare. The barriers are different for different industries, but they \nexist. In fact, foreign investment in China is divided into four \ncategories--encouraged, permitted, restricted, and prohibited. Even in \nthe nonprohibited categories, all foreign investment must be approved \nby the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation called MFTEC.\n  The United States has a policy of being open to foreign direct \ninvestment in nearly every case, and strict levels of Government \napproval are only reserved for the most sensitive transactions \ninvolving national security. Of the 1,525 cases that have been filed \nwith the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States since \n1988, only 25 have warranted investigation; 12 have been reported to \nthe President, and only one has been denied. In the converse situation, \nwhere American firms seek to buy Chinese companies, the devil is often \nin the details. The Chinese Government creates de facto barriers that \nalmost always require Western companies to give up some degree of \ncontrol over its enterprise that would be highly irregular in any truly \nfree market.\n  What is more, it is nearly impossible to gain an accurate picture of \nwhich investments, mergers, and joint ventures are rejected by the \nChinese Government because companies' investors don't publicly want to \nadmit it. The Chinese will say to General Motors or General Electric or \nscores of smaller companies: We will let you do it, but only under \nthese circumstances. And the company, not wanting to offend the \nChinese, doesn't fight the circumstances. All too often these large \ncompanies have an interest to their shareholders--they are supposed \nto--but not to the United States. If it serves their interest to send \nthe technology to China, even though it will create many jobs in China \nand hurt jobs here in the United States, so be it. It is good for \nGeneral Motors. So it is hard to figure this out. As I said, we have \nbegun to do it, and we will be issuing a report shortly about it.\n  There are additional complications when a U.S. company wants to merge \nor acquire a Chinese state-owned enterprise such as a CNOOC, which is a \nstate-owned enterprise, because any merger with an SOE requires \nadditional approval of many state agencies, and so in instance after \ninstance, which we will highlight in our report, the Chinese do not \nplay the same way with our companies that they want us to play with \ntheir companies.\n  What our amendment does is very simple. It does not prohibit a merger \nfrom taking place. It simply requires a report be submitted to the \nSecretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, to \nassess whether that country will allow a similar transaction to occur \nin the opposite direction. The aim is not building barriers but simple \nreciprocity--fair, part of free trade, and better for everybody.\n  I hope my colleagues will accept this amendment. It doesn't go to the \nheart of this merger--that is a different issue which we will delay and \ndo on a different bill--but, rather, goes to the point that the Chinese \nshould treat our companies the way they want us to treat theirs.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 66, "speaker": "Mr. SCHUMER", "itemno": 88}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank my \nfriend from West Virginia, as I have often done on the floor of the \nSenate, for his advice, and sometimes consent, to my own views.\n  Mr. President, that group of 14 did provide the foundation for our \nleaders--Republican and Democrat--to bring forth the nominations of six \nFederal circuit judges, each of whom received the advice and consent of \nthe Senate, and now serve as federal judges.

For 3 reasons: First, as a \n     courtesy to the committee and to our guests who have been \n     very patient; secondly, this nominee, John Roberts, is indeed \n     one of the most outstanding that I have ever had the \n     privilege of presenting on behalf of a President in my 25 \n     years in the U.S. Senate.

And I just \n     reminisced with the nominee. I was the 34th lawyer in that \n     firm, which was one of the largest in the Nation's capital. \n     Today, there are 1,000 members of that law firm, to show you \n     the change in the practice of law in the half-century that I \n     have been a witness to this.\n       Mr. Chairman, you covered in your opening remarks every \n     single fact that I had hopefully desired to inform the \n     committee. So, again, for that reason you have, most \n     courteously, Mr. Chairman, stated all of the pertinent facts \n     about this extraordinary man, having graduated from Harvard, \n     summa cum laude, in 1976. Three years later, he graduated \n     from Harvard Law School, magna cum laude, where he served as \n     managing editor of the Harvard Law Review. Those of us who \n     have pursued the practice of law know that few of us could \n     have ever attained that status. Even if I went back and \n     started all over again, I could not do it. He served as law \n     clerk to Judge Friendly on the U.S. Court of\n\n\n     Appeals for the Second Circuit and worked as a law clerk to \n     the current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Judge \n     Rehnquist--Justice Rehnquist.\n       So I commend the President, I commend this nominee.

Therefore, based on \nwhat I know today regarding John Roberts and my own independent \ninvestigation at the time I was privileged to introduce him, I can only \nopine as this process evolves that there will not be, in my judgment, a \nbody of fact that would give rise in any way to invoking the \nextraordinary circumstances provision of the Gang of 14's memorandum of \nunderstanding.\n  Again, I carefully couch that, reserving my respect, as we all do, \nfor the work to be done by the Judiciary Committee. But in the end, I \nrepeat, I do not think there will be any body of fact that will give \nrise to invoking the extraordinary circumstances clause.\n  I had the pleasure this morning to call quite a few friends all \nacross the Commonwealth of Virginia, on both sides of the spectrum, to \nlisten to their views about this nominee. I regard those conversations \nas private, certainly in terms of the names of the individuals. But I \nwas given the liberty to say two individuals, whom I have known for my \nentire 27 years plus--I will add 1 year, 28 years, 1 year campaigning \nfor the Senate when I knew them both--two of the most extraordinary and \nnationally and internationally known religious leaders shared with me \ntheir strong approval and appreciation to the President for the \nnomination of this distinguished gentleman.\n  Likewise, I talked with a number of friends on the other side of the \nspectrum, two of whom are acknowledged liberals whom I have known for \ndecades and whose opinions I value from time to time. These individuals \nwith whom I spoke this morning have known Judge Roberts, and they \nlikewise recognize the extraordinary credentials of this fine \nindividual, and I think in their own ways expressed strong support.\n  I mention that because I think it is important for all of us to reach \nout and seek the views of those who feel, as I do, that this nomination \nis one of the most important contemporary chapters of American history.\n  Also, this morning, in response to several press inquiries about the \nSenate, I have stated that I unequivocally believe that this \ninstitution will proceed with its responsibilities under the \nConstitution, under the advice and consent clause, in a manner that \nreflects credit on the Senate itself and in a manner that reflects \nfairness and dignity towards the nominee. I believe that the Senate \nwill proceed in the finest traditions of its over 200 years of \nexperience in terms of its duties of advice and consent, and I think \nour Nation, and indeed, much of the world, will concur when the process \nis finally complete.\n  I conclude by moving into that terrain that is always a bit \ndangerous--listening to good friends who have known John Roberts for \nmany years talk about him. I met with him briefly this morning. We \njoked together about this. He said: Now, I am a little apprehensive, \nJohn, about some of the persons with whom you talked. But in any event, \njust the warmest accolades were extended by old friends who mentioned \nthe fact that John Roberts had been very active in what we call pro \nbono cases.\n  When I was an assistant U.S. attorney in the District for years, I \nsaw the abuses of the system where those apprehended under the law for \nalleged criminal violations did not receive the quality of legal \nrepresentation to which they were entitled. I participated with a \nnumber of my friends in establishing at Georgetown University the \nPrettyman Institute, which trains young lawyers in how to deal with pro \nbono cases. I remember Judge Oliver Gasch, now the late Judge Gasch, \nwho was very active in working with me, as we worked with the \nGeorgetown University Law School and established that institute. It has \nbeen very successful.\n  I mention that because John Roberts has had quite a record, as has \nHogan & Hartson, in pro bono representation of those whose economic \ncircumstances are so much less fortunate than ours, but nevertheless \nare entitled to first-class representation, and this fine lawyer and \njurist has given that in years past.\n  In addition, in the firm of Hogan & Hartson, John Roberts was also \noften sought out by the young lawyers to counsel with them on how best \nto do his expertise, that is appellate court work. That is always \nmagnificent in a firm when there is an individual to whom the young \nlawyers can go, perhaps those outside of the firm too, and get advice.\n  Also, there is a small lunchroom in the firm now and there is a table \nthere. It is interesting, the table is dedicated to William Fulbright, \na distinguished Member of the Senate who later worked with Hogan & \nHartson. Around that table some great conversations occurred. Often, \nwhen John Roberts was at the table with his other partners and fellow \nlawyers in the firm, they recognized that he could be engaged in almost \nany subject and have a serious contribution. For example, he loves \nsports. Like so many of us, given the opportunity, when he gets up in \nthe morning, he kind of looks at the sports page before he goes to all \nof the news on the other pages. Certainly I do, and I think a lot of \nAmericans do that. He can give you statistics about the Redskins and \nthe baseball teams and others. It is extraordinary.\n  When I look at the entirety of this individual and look at the \nAmerican public--I am not talking just about the interest groups who \nwill take a role in this one way or another, as they should and are \nentitled to, but I am talking about those citizens who watch our \ngovernment perform its duties--I believe the American public will judge \nthis individual as the facts come out. For those who will follow it, it \nwill be quite an education with regard to not only the institution of \nthe Senate and its constitutional responsibilities of advice and \nconsent, but the law of the land and the very large number of issues \nthat face this Nation today, issues that may well come before the \nSupreme Court someday.\n  So there is an educational process for all of us to be had. But I \nthink in the final analysis, the American public will say to itself: \nThis man has the right stuff and will do the right thing for America \nand for us as individuals.\n  Mr. President, I have already placed in the Record my introduction of \nthen-lawyer Roberts, now Judge Roberts, at two previous hearings. I \nhave an extraordinary letter written by, I think, about 150 lawyers, \nmany of whom I know because so many of them I have had associations \nwith through the\n\n\nyears. It is addressed to the leadership of the Judiciary Committee. It \nsays:\n\n       The undersigned are all members of the Bar of the District \n     of Columbia and we are writing in support of the nomination \n     of John G. Roberts, Jr., to serve as a federal court of \n     appeals judge. . . .\n\n  It is extraordinary. It is Democrats on one side, Republicans on the \nright, and a mixture in the center. I cannot recall in my years here \never seeing a document of such import as this in the context of a \njudicial nomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.", "turn": 71, "speaker": "Mr. WARNER", "itemno": 99}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in ", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 100}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "the Record, as follows:\n                                                December 18, 2002.\n     Re Judicial nomination of John G.

He is one of the very best and most \n     highly respected appellate lawyers in the nation, with a \n     deserved reputation as a brilliant writer and oral advocate. \n     He is also a wonderful professional colleague both because of \n     his enormous skills and because of his unquestioned integrity \n     and fair-mindedness. In short, John Roberts represents the \n     best of the bar and, we have no doubt, would be a superb \n     federal court of appeals judge.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n         Donald B.

Mr. President, let me inform my colleagues that this \namendment is acceptable to the managers of the underlying bill, Senator \nMcConnell and Senator Leahy. I thank them for their work on behalf of \nthis particular effort.\n  At the conclusion of my remarks, I will not ask that the amendment be \nadopted at this juncture. Senator McConnell and Senator Leahy prefer \nthat occur at a later time. I wish to take the opportunity to address \nthe amendment and the rationale for it.\n  I again thank my colleagues, the chairman and ranking member, for \naccepting the amendment to the Foreign Operations bill.\n  The amendment I am offering on behalf of myself, Senator Nelson of \nFlorida, and Senator Reed, relates to the situation in the Republic of \nHaiti. The island nation shares the island of Hispaniola with the \nDominican Republic in the Caribbean. The situation there cries out, as \nany other place in the world, to this body. I have spoken about my \nconcerns with respect to the ongoing crisis in Haiti many times on this \nfloor, as have some of my colleagues.\n  I commend particularly Senator DeWine of Ohio who has not only spoken \nabout this issue on numerous occasions but, as a result of the efforts \nhe and his family have made, has a very direct involvement in trying to \nimprove the lives of the people in Haiti and has visited the country \nmany times. Those concerns, unfortunately, no matter how often \nexpressed by myself, Senator DeWine, and others, have fallen on deaf \nears, unfortunately, in the Bush administration. Apparently, no one in \nthe current administration has made Haiti a priority, and it shows.\n  I support providing assistance to Haiti, but I do not believe in \nthrowing good money after bad in that situation. Frankly, moneys in \nthis appropriations bill in support of the current election schedule in \nHaiti are moneys that, in my view, will be totally wasted unless and \nuntil the Bush administration gets serious about addressing the \nfoundations of that insecurity--the absence of the rule of law and the \npresence of armed groups who today terrorize Haiti's cities and towns.\n  That is why I offer this amendment today to insist that prior to one \npenny of this money being spent on the election process in Haiti that \nwe in Congress be informed about the administration's game plan for \nHaiti, if it has one; and if one does not exist, that they develop such \na plan so that the U.S. taxpayers' dollars are not wasted on elections \nthat would be deemed illegitimate at best.\n  I don't think that elections are the be-all and end-all for solving \nHaiti's problems. Frankly, I am increasingly of the view that more \ninternational involvement is needed in Haiti over an extended period of \ntime before any Haitian government has a chance of successfully \ngoverning a country which at this juncture is virtually ungovernable. \nIncreased international involvement is unthinkable without U.S. \nleadership.\n\n  The political, economic, and social chaos that exists in Haiti today \nhas created one of the most serious humanitarian crises confronting the \ninternational community. More than a year after the ouster of former \nPresident Aristide, most Haitians today have abysmal living conditions \nand they are getting worse by the day.\n  According to U.S. officials in Haiti, most Haitians, most of the 8 \nmillion people on the one-third of that island of Hispaniola, live on a \ndollar or less a day. More than 40 percent of the children are \nmalnourished, and childbirth is the second leading cause of death among \nwomen.\n  Haiti's AIDS infection rate is the highest outside of sub-Saharan \nAfrica, and an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 Haitian children are born with \nthe virus each year. The average Haitian has a life expectancy of 51 \nyears. That is 20 years short of the Latin American/Caribbean average \nof 71 years.\n  Haiti's economy is also in a total shambles. Gross domestic product \nhas been negative in that country for two decades running. Profits from \ntraditional exports of coffee, rice, rum, and other agricultural \nproducts of the formal economy are less than half of what they were 20 \nyears ago. Now, remittances from Haitians living abroad are one of the \nmain sources of income. In fact, these remittances account for almost \none-third of Haiti's gross domestic product.\n  What has been the Bush administration's response to the Haitian \ncrisis? Frankly, the administration has been AWOL on Haiti. While they \nwere quick to seize the opportunity to facilitate the removal of the \ndemocratically elected President from office, since then there has been \na decided disinterest on the part of the administration with respect to \nthe fate of the Haitian people.\n  Last July, the United States pledged approximately $230 million in \naid for fiscal year 2004-2005. This past April, the Senate passed the \nDeWine-Bingaman amendment, of which I was a cosponsor, providing $20 \nmillion for election assistance, employment, and public works. But all \nof the assistance in the world is not going to solve Haiti's problems \nuntil we begin to address the levels of insecurity that exist in that \ncountry.\n  Haiti borders on being a completely failed state if it is not one \nalready. Yet, this administration continues to suggest that elections \nshould go forward later this year so the Haitian people can replace the \ninterim government. Last month, Assistant Secretary of State Roger \nNoriega and special envoys from France, Canada, and Brazil visited \nPort-au-Prince and said that Haiti's political transition was on \ntarget. They said the date for the Presidential and legislative \nelections, November 13, should remain fixed. I wonder how anyone could \nvisit Haiti and come to that conclusion.\n  Last December, Senator DeWine and I were told we could not visit \nPort-au-Prince because the security situation was far too dangerous. In \nlate May of this year, the State Department issued the following travel \nwarning on Haiti:\n\n       Due to the volatile security situation, the Department has \n     ordered the departure of nonemergency personnel and all \n     family members of U.S. Embassy personnel. The Department of \n     State warns U.S. citizens to defer travel to Haiti and urges \n     American citizens to depart the country if they can do so \n     safely.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire travel warning issued by the \nDepartment of State be printed in the Record.", "turn": 80, "speaker": "Mr. DODD", "itemno": 112}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in ", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 113}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "the Record, as follows:\n\n                             Travel Warning\n\n   (Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Washington, DC)\n\n       May 26, 2005.--This Travel Warning is being issued to warn \n     American citizens of the continued dangers of travel to \n     Haiti. Due to the volatile security situation, the Department \n     has ordered the departure of non-emergency personnel and all \n     family members of U.S. Embassy personnel. The Department of \n     State warns U.S. citizens to defer travel to Haiti and urges \n     American citizens to depart the country if they can do so \n     safely. This Travel Warning supersedes the Travel Warning \n     issued March 11, 2005.\n       Americans are reminded of the potential for spontaneous \n     demonstrations and violent confrontations between armed \n     groups. Visitors and residents must remain vigilant due to \n     the absence of an effective force in much of Haiti; the \n     potential for looting; the presence of intermittent \n     roadblocks set by\n\n\n     armed gangs or by the police; and the possibility of random \n     violent crime, including kidnapping, carjacking, and assault. \n     Due to concerns for the safety of its personnel, the \n     Department has ordered the departure from Haiti of all U.S. \n     Embassy non-emergency employees and all family members of \n     American embassy personnel. American citizens who remain in \n     Haiti despite this warning are urged to consider departing.\n       Travel can be hazardous within Port-au-Prince. Some areas \n     are off-limits to embassy staff, including downtown Port-au-\n     Prince after dark. The embassy has imposed a curfew from 9:00 \n     p.m. to 5:00 a.m., which could change periodically. Staff \n     members must remain in their homes or in U.S. government \n     facilities during the hours covered by the curfew. The \n     embassy has limited travel by its staff outside of Port-au-\n     Prince and the ability to provide emergency services to U.S. \n     citizens outside of Port-au-Prince remains extremely limited. \n     U.S. businesses continue to operate in Haiti, but take \n     special precautions to protect their facilities and \n     personnel. The U.N. stabilization force (MINUSTAH) is fully \n     deployed and is assisting the government of Haiti in \n     providing security. They have challenged violent gangs and \n     have moved into some gang enclaves.\n       U.S. citizens who travel to or remain in Haiti despite this \n     Travel Warning must remain vigilant with regard to their \n     personal security and are strongly advised to\n     register either online at https://\ntravelregistration.state.gov/ibrs/ or contact the Consular \n     Section of the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince and enroll in \n     the warden system (emergency alert network) to obtain updated \n     information on travel and security in Haiti. The Consular \n     Section of the U.S. Embassy can be reached at (509) 223-7011, \n     the fax number is (509) 223-9665 and the e-mail address is \n     acspap@state.gov.

Mr. President, that travel warning remains in effect today. \nYet, the administration would have us believe that things are on track \nfor holding elections as currently scheduled. Unless there is dramatic \naction, the likelihood of fair elections in Haiti with widespread voter \nparticipation in the near future is remote, at best, and I would argue \nvirtually impossible.\n  Currently, fewer than 100,000 of the 4 million potential voters have \nbeen registered and fewer than a quarter of the necessary registration \ncenters are even open at all. As important, the role of all parties in \nthe elections needs to be protected.\n  All parties must have a fair and equal chance if these elections are \nto be legitimate. Ultimately, what should matter most to the United \nStates is that institutionally these elections are legitimate and fair. \nWhoever wins must make reforms, purge corrupt officials, and work to \nimprove security.\n  In my view, United States engagement on the security situation is \njust the first step in what will be a very long, uphill battle if we \nare going to get the situation right in Haiti. Holding elections for \nthe sake of holding elections on some rigid schedule makes no sense at \nall. Elections, particularly elections with little or no credibility, \nare not going to solve Haiti's problems. It is simply going to compound \nthem.\n  Haiti is in a humanitarian crisis. For that reason alone, the United \nStates should be far more engaged than we are. Frankly, after sending \ntroops to Haiti 4 times in the past 90 years, it is also in our \neconomic interest to address the problem resolutely. We should start by \nreviving Senator DeWine's HERO Act, as it is called, which would help \nreinvigorate the Haitian economy by granting preferential trade \nagreements to certain Haitian textile products.\n  A year ago, the Senate passed the HERO bill, offered by Senator \nDeWine, unanimously in this body. There was not a single vote in \nopposition to Senator DeWine's proposal. The other body, the House of \nRepresentatives, unfortunately would not even consider the legislation. \nIf the HERO Act were passed, as it should be, it could help to \nstrengthen Haiti's economy and jump-start real employment in that \nlittle island nation. Especially now that the Senate has passed and the \nHouse will soon act on the Dominican Republic-Central American Free \nTrade Agreement, this is doubly important. After all, it simply does \nnot make any sense to help the Dominican Republic on two-thirds of the \nisland and leave Haiti a completely failed state on the other one-third \nof that island.\n  As it stands now, the options for honest employment are slim to none \nin the Haitian city centers, particularly the slums of the capital, \nPort-au-Prince. The major employers in that country are warring gangs, \nmany of them involved in trafficking cocaine.\n  Indeed, Haiti today is the major transit point for cocaine coming in \nfrom South American countries such as Colombia. From the year 2000 to \n2004, approximately 8 percent of all the cocaine coming to the United \nStates passed through Haiti. Entire neighborhoods of that country are \nunder the control of these criminal gangs which are responsible for \nkillings, robberies and, increasingly, kidnappings. Authorities in the \ninterim government estimate that each day there are 6 to 12 kidnappings \nin Port-au-Prince alone.\n  In total, more than 700 people, including 7 peacekeepers for the \nUnited Nations, have been killed in Haiti in the last 8 months. The \nU.N. forces have tried to respond to the security threats, but frankly \nthe U.N. force is not in a position to quell the violence in Haiti's \nmajor cities or to secure many of Haiti's major roads, both of which \nare now under the control of these criminal gangs.\n  For one, they are trying to protect a population roughly equal to \nthat of New York City, roughly 8 million people. New York City has \n40,000 well-trained and equipped police officers. Haiti has a tiny \nfraction of that number of U.N. peacekeepers. I would hope the recent \nU.N. Security Council authorization for an additional 1,000 troops and \npolice will help the U.N. force wrest control from these criminals, but \nI doubt it.\n  Secondly, and perhaps even more important than sheer numbers, the \nUnited Nations mandate does not give the U.N. forces real authority \nover the Haitian national police, a force that is in severe disarray.\n  The national police are good people in many cases, but there are many \nbad ones indeed who need to be removed. If the U.N. force wants the \ntrust of civilians, they need to make sure the Haitian national police \ndo not ignore human rights or violations in the face of high \ninsecurity, which only fuels the cycle of violence.\n  Simply put, the credibility of the U.N. force is directly tied to its \nability to bring some calm and to prevent abuses. To that end, \ncivilians should be able to contact U.N. forces directly about the \nabuses by the national police. That does not happen.\n  I am also troubled by the interim government, led by President \nBoniface Alexandre and Prime Minister Gerard Latortue. They have \ndelayed justice for thousands of prisoners. Roughly 20 of the more than \n7,000 prisoners at the federal penitentiary have been convicted of \ncrimes. Many of them have spent years awaiting trial.\n  I am particularly concerned about the treatment of former Prime \nMinister Yvon Neptune who has been held without formal charges for over \na year and is near death after a series of off-and-on hunger strikes \nwhich he began in February. Now in the sixth month of his protest, I am \ntold his rib cage is sticking out of his skin and he is maybe near \ndeath.\n  On May 25, Prime Minister Neptune was carried to his first hearing on \na stretcher where he testified for several hours. He denied the \naccusations that he masterminded the killings of 25 Haitians in the \ntown of St. Marc and has refused to leave Haiti, despite that offer, \nuntil his name is cleared.\n  The basic point is when it comes to legal issues, it is imperative \nthat the interim government set the tone that the rule of law matters. \nIf they do not set the example at the top, lawlessness will not improve \nat the bottom. The amendment I am offering is meant to serve as a small \nwake-up call to the administration and to the Congress that we are \nwatching what is happening. It is meant to send the message that Haiti \nis only going to have a future if we are prepared to extend a helping \nhand. What we need now is resolve and a serious commitment from the \nhighest levels of our Government to bring peace, security, and \nstability to the people of this small island nation.\n  We have lost interest before. The result is clear. We cannot afford \nto do it again. The United States should help the Haitian people create \nan honest government committed to justice, committed to combating \npoverty, committed to democracy, and to a better\n\n\nHaiti. I hope the Bush administration will make that commitment. I hope \nforcing them to take a serious look at conditions on the ground and \nresponding accordingly will produce results.\n\n  Again, one does not need to have a Ph.D. in political science to know \nwhat the net effect will be if we do not get more serious about Haiti. \nHaitians will do what they have done, as other peoples have done in \nother nations who have been confronted by similar fact situations. \nHaiti is only a few miles off our coast, roughly about 110, 120 miles. \nHaitians will do what they have done historically. They will leave in \ndroves and they will seek safe refuge wherever they can achieve it. \nObviously we do not want that situation to occur again.\n  So the modest proposal to try and inject some sanity into our policy \nwe hope will stem that tide. I think even more serious measures need to \nbe taken by the international community such as a protectorate of some \nkind to create some stability there over the coming 10 or 15 years to \ngive any hope to the Haitian people to regain control of their own \nsociety.\n  Words that I can't even conjure up cannot describe the situation in \nthis country. It is getting worse by the hour. Every day we delay, \nevery time we refuse to do what needs to be done, we contribute in our \nown way to neglect, to a deteriorating situation in that country.\n  I again want to thank my colleagues Senator McConnell, Senator Leahy, \nSenator Nelson of Florida, and Senator Reed, for their support of this \namendment. Again, it is not going to solve all the problems, but it may \nserve to get some attention.\n  I understand the focus on Iraq and the focus on Afghanistan. We \ncannot neglect the Caribbean. We cannot neglect Haiti.

Mr. President, I am happy to join with my colleague, \nSenator Feingold, in offering an amendment extending the mandate of the \nSpecial Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, SIGIR. The Special \nInspector General serves as a watchdog over the billions of U.S. \ntaxpayer dollars allocated for Iraq reconstruction. It has been \neffective in its role, uncovering and exposing a wide range of problems \nwith the use of taxpayer funds in Iraq. For example, in reports \nreleased on May 4, the SIGIR documented instances of files that could \nnot be located by contract managers, contract funds that no one could \naccount for, and failures by U.S. officials to live up to commitments \nmade to Iraqi authorities regarding the management of funds slated to \nrebuild Iraq. The SIGIR also found indications of potential criminal \nactivity in the case of the South-Central Iraq audit, where managers \ncould not account for what happened to $96.6 million of $119.9 million \nthat was disbursed in South-Central Iraq.\n  The SIGIR's tenure is currently 10 months after 80 percent of Iraqi \nrelief and reconstruction funds are obligated, rather than expended. As \na result, his term could expire well before all of the work that has \nbeen contracted has been performed and payments have been made. Current \nestimates are that Iraq reconstruction fund obligations could meet the \n80 percent threshold very soon. The Feingold-Collins amendment would \nextend the SIGIR's tenure by changing the termination date to 10 months \nafter 80 percent of the funds are expended.\n  As chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, which oversees government contracting, \nI meet with and receive briefings regularly from the Inspector General \non the office's ongoing work and findings. He conducts needed, on-the-\nground oversight of contracts in Iraq. His audit and investigative work \nprovides much needed transparency of these operations and demonstrates \nto the new Iraqi government the importance of openness and oversight to \na democratic society.\n  Despite its effectiveness, the SIGIR office is set to begin closing \ndown before the majority of reconstruction funds for Iraq have even \nbeen expended. We need to extend the mandate of this office to help \nmake sure that American tax dollars are being used effectively and \nefficiently, and to help our reconstruction effort succeed.\n  Without the SIGIR's experienced oversight, I fear that we may \nencounter an increase in fraud, waste, and abuse in the management and \nadministration of Iraq reconstruction contracts.", "turn": 123, "speaker": "Ms. COLLINS", "itemno": 175}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M000355", "text": "  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, an important part of U.S. nuclear \nnonproliferation policy is the continuing effort to deter other \ncountries from testing a nuclear weapon. It is often said that a \ncountry could build a relatively simple nuclear weapon, like the bomb \nexploded at Hiroshima, and use it with confidence even though it has \nnot tested the device. That does not hold true, however, for more \ncomplex designs; and military commanders are loath to rely upon any \nweapon that has not been tested.\n  One major way to deter countries from conducting nuclear weapons \ntests is to ensure that such a test would be detected. That's because \nmost countries, as signers of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban \nTreaty, the CTBT, are bound to refrain from acts that would undermine \nthe object and purpose of that treaty, even though it has yet to enter \ninto force. In addition, nearly all nuclear weapons states, including \nsome that are not parties to the CTBT, have proclaimed unilateral \nmoratoria on nuclear weapons tests.\n\n\nThus, there are both legal and political barriers to openly testing \nnuclear weapons.\n  How can we make it more likely that a covert nuclear weapons test \nwould be detected and identified? One way is through U.S. and allied \ndata collection, including the fine seismic network put together by the \nAir Force Technical Applications Center, or AFTAC. I support and \napplaud the work of AFTAC, which is truly a center of excellence. But \nAFTAC cannot and does not do everything; not every country will \ncooperate with the United States in the nuclear detection mission; and \nwhen we use AFTAC, we pay the full bill.\n  AFTAC's work is supplemented importantly by the International \nMonitoring System, or IMS, that is being set up by the Preparatory \nCommission for the CTBT Organization, the CTBTO PrepCom. The worldwide \nseismic network of the IMS will include sites in Russia, China, Iran \nand elsewhere that cannot be duplicated through U.S. or bilateral \narrangements. It will also combine long-distance, low-frequency, or \nteleseismic, coverage with high-frequency, regional seismic data that \nmany experts believe will do a better job of detecting a ``decoupled'' \nexplosion that uses an existing cavity to resist detection.\n  The IMS will marshal four different types of data--not only seismic, \nbut also hydroacoustic, infrasound, and airborne radionuclide \nemissions--collected at 321 sites, mostly seismic arrays. The use of \nmultiple methodologies will make it more difficult for a country to \nevade detection, as it gets very difficult to design a test that avoids \ndetection by all four means. And the rest of the world is paying more \nthan three quarters of the cost of this robust monitoring system.\n  Finally, while national technical means may include very sensitive \nintelligence information, the IMS will provide data that can be used \nopenly for diplomatic or enforcement purposes. That will greatly ease \nthe pressure on U.S. intelligence to expose sensitive sources or \nmethods in order to further U.S. foreign policy objectives.\n  The administration rightly supports the IMS and has funded the U.S. \nshare of IMS expenses for several years. Secretary of State Rice \nconfirmed the administration's support for this program earlier this \nyear, in response to a question for the record that I asked after she \ntestified on the foreign affairs budget.\n  In addition, the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security, Mr. Joseph, has assured the Foreign Relations \nCommittee that funding the IMS is fully consistent with the \nadministration's position on the CTBT, which it has said that the \nUnited States will not join, even though it is a signatory to the \ntreaty. While I wish that the administration were of a different mind \non the CTBT itself, I think they are absolutely correct in their view \nthat the IMS serves our national security interests even if this \ncountry never ratifies the CTBT.\n  Unfortunately, the Office of Management and Budget imposed a severe \ncut on this budget item, reducing the State Department's request from \n$22,000,000 to $14,350,000. The Secretary of State assured the Foreign \nRelations Committee that the State Department is committed to finding \nthe extra funds, even if they have to be obtained in the fiscal year \n2007 budget. That's no way to run a railroad, however, and it could be \ndifficult to get over $30 million next year to make up for the \nshortfall. It would be far better to find some of that extra money now \nand not put the United States so far in arrears.\n  I propose, therefore, that an extra $5 million be made available for \nthe U.S. contribution to the CTBTO PrepCom. I am joined in this \namendment by the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, my good \nfriend Senator Lugar of Indiana, which I very much appreciate. The \nadditional funds will make it much more likely that the United States \nwill find the money to pay its full assessment for IMS and will help \nkeep the world from becoming a much more dangerous place.\n  Staff to Senators McConnell and Leahy have kindly worked with us on \nthis amendment and identified the budget for economic support funds as \nan area in which a $5 million cut could be absorbed with less harm to \nour national security than we would risk by failing to fund the IMS in \na timely manner. I understand that the managers of this bill are \nprepared to accept our amendment and can cover the difference in first-\nyear outlays that will result.

The U.S. continues to support and \n     participate in those activities of the Preparatory Commission \n     for the CTBT Organization (CTBTO PrepCom) in Vienna that \n     pertain to the IMS, and the U.S. has no plans to press the \n     PrepCom to lower its budget to a level commensurate with the \n     $14.35 million that the Administration has allocated for it \n     in FY06.\n       Unfortunately, budgets are very tight and cuts had to be \n     made, even among programs supported by the Administration. A \n     number of other cuts were made in the Department's program \n     requests, including in the areas of non-proliferation and \n     counter-terrorism. The level of funding for a program in any \n     given year's budget does not necessarily have a bearing on \n     the funding level for that program in the succeeding years.\n       It is important to note that the U.S. continues to observe \n     a nuclear testing moratorium and encourages other states not \n     to test.

I had originally intended to offer the \nsame amendment here in the Senate, however, the Senator from Kentucky, \nthe chairman of the subcommittee, has graciously offered to work with \nme on the issue.\n  While the amendment would have specifically limited assistance to \nRomania provided under the Assistance for Eastern Europe and the Baltic \nStates, SEED, account, the real problem we are trying to address is the \nplight of over 100 American families and almost 200 Romanian orphans \nthese families have agreed to adopt. Despite the fact that the \nadoptions have been approved by Romania, these young orphans and their \nnew American families have been waiting in limbo--for years in some \ninstances.\n  After approving these adoptions, Romania changed its adoption laws in \norder to comply with the European Union's legal standards as a \ncondition of admittance into the European Union. However, since \nchanging their law, Romanian officials have yet to clarify the status \nof these adoptions or act in any manner to fulfill the commitments that \nwere made to these caring and compassionate Americans--or to fulfill \nthe hopes of their own orphans.\n  This past March, Romanian President Basescu indicated to Members of \nCongress, representatives from the State Department, and several of the \naffected families that as soon as the European Union voted to admit \nRomania, his government would then move expeditiously to resolve the \npreviously approved adoption cases. While the European Union voted to \nadmit Romania in April, Mr. Basescu's pledge has yet to be honored by \nhis government.\n  Romania became a good ally of the United States almost immediately \nafter the breakup of the Soviet Union and indeed played a pivotal role \nleading to the breakup. It is out of respect for the generally good \nrelations between our countries--and with the hope that Romania will \nreciprocate in equal good faith--that I have decided not to offer the \namendment in the Senate as I originally planned to do. Instead, I will \nwork during the conference on the bill to come up with a solution to \nthis issue which is in the best interests not only of our two \ncountries, but those of the families and orphans who have unnecessarily \nbeen kept apart too long as well.\n  I hope that the Romanian Government will seize this opportunity \nafforded to them and take appropriate and expeditious action--\nposthaste--to allow these children to join their new families here in \nAmerica.", "turn": 147, "speaker": "Mr. GREGG", "itemno": 214}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M000355", "text": "  Mr. McCONNELL.

As a result, approximately 1.8 million people die every \nyear from diarrheal disease, and sadly, 90 percent of those deaths \noccur in children under the age of 5.\n  With an increasing world population and further constraints on our \nworld's water resources, the problem is expected to worsen \nsignificantly before it begins to improve.\n  I commend the assistant majority leader, Senator McConnell, the \nchairman of the foreign operations appropriations subcommittee, for \nproviding $200 million to the U.S. Agency for International Development \nfor safe water programs in his bill. Further, the chairman has \nallocated not less than $50 million of that amount for programs in \nAfrica, where the need is significant.\n  In addition to Government aid, there is a growing effort in the \nprivate, nonprofit sector to address this problem as well. \nOrganizations such as Millennium Water Alliance, Water Missions \nInternational, Living Water International, Water for People, The Nature \nConservancy, Winrock International, The Aspen Institute, and many \nothers are working to address global water issues.

I very much appreciate the assistance of Senator McConnell and \nSenator Leahy in that regard.\n  The Cedar Revolution, in which the people of Lebanon have expressed \ntheir frustration with outside interference in their internal affairs \nand with a sectarian brand of politics that has produced corruption, \nundemocratic practices, and a faltering economy, has inspired hope for \nmajor political transformation not only in Lebanon, but in other \ncountries of the Middle East as well. It is important to express our \nsupport for the people of Lebanon, both symbolically and in concrete \nterms that will assist them in reviving their economy and in carrying \nforward a process of reform that still requires much effort and \ndetermination.\n  Fortunately, the Agency for International development has for some \nyears run a small but effective assistance program in the country, \nrelying largely on American nongovernmental organizations and education \ninstitutions which operate in Lebanon. USAID therefore has the \nexperience and the partners to efficiently put additional assistance to \ngood use. The\n\n\npriorities should continue to be fostering fundamental democratic \nprinciples and economic recovery.\n  My amendment recognizes, as has the Appropriations Committee in its \nbill, the special role of the American educational institutions in \nachieving these goals. The American schools in Lebanon, through \nscholarships that these funds make possible, prepare the next \ngeneration of leaders by graduating young men and women who have a \nsolid understanding of the forces of globalization, are committed to \ndemocratic values, and have the skills to reform their societies and \nbridge the differences between those societies and the West. Young \nleaders such as these will assure the future not just of Lebanon, but \nof the region as a whole. Lebanon benefits when such men and women from \nthroughout the Middle East are educated at the renowned American \nschools in the country, as does the United States. It is therefore my \nintention that scholarship funds made available for these schools can \nbe provided for students from any country within the region.", "turn": 165, "speaker": "Mr. SUNUNU", "itemno": 232}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000888", "text": "  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, a significant amount of time and effort \ngoes into preparing this bill every year.

Over the past few months, they have worked \nalongside my staff helping to draft a bill and report. They have my \nspecial thanks for a job well done.\n  Recognition also goes to LaShawnda Smith, Tom Hawkins, Harry Christy, \nand Paul Grove of my staff. I thank LaShawnda for keeping the \nsubcommittee running. She does a terrific job.\n  Since coming to State-Foreign Operations 9 months ago, Tom has proven \nan invaluable member of our team. His oversight of the security and \ncounternarcotics programs is outstanding. Thank you, Tom.\n  Instead of protecting the President, Harry, a detailee from the \nSecret Service, has assumed his temporary duties as an appropriator in \na professional manner. His work on State Department accounts has been \ninvaluable, particularly given the most recent expansion of the \nsubcommittee's jurisdiction.\n  Finally, I certainly want to thank Paul Grove, staff director, for \nhis many years of great service with me on this assignment and other \nassignments in the past. There are many other people without whose help \nwe would literally have no bill to report at all. I thank Bob Putnam, \nJack Conway and, of course, Keith Kennedy. They should know that our \nstaff greatly appreciates their patience, guidance and, when required, \ngood humor.\n  For words, the editorial and printing shop is top-notch. Richard \nLarson is a consummate professional, nothing less than a committee \ntreasure.
