Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend one of my \nconstituents, Subhashree Madhavan, and her Rembrandt Project Team at \nthe National Institutes of Health. Ms. Madhavan and her colleagues were \nrecently named among thirty finalists for the 2005 Service to America \nmedals awarded by the Partnership for Public Service.\n\n\n  The Service to America award program recognizes career Federal \nemployees for their significant contributions to the Nation. Recipients \nof the ``Sammies'' are among the best and brightest of our public \nservants. While we seldom give public recognition to their efforts, \nthey devote their lives and careers to the cause of our national \nwelfare. They are models to the rest of the Federal workforce and \ninspirations to us all.\n  Since joining the National Cancer Institute Center for Bioinformatics \nat NIH, Ms. Madhavan has overseen the development of the Rembrandt \nProject. Rembrandt (REpository for Molecular BRAin Neoplasia DaTa) is a \ndatabase that brings together data from an NCI clinical study with a \nvast store of existing data on brain tumors. By bridging the gap \nbetween clinical and biological information, Rembrandt will facilitate \nthe diagnosis and treatment of individual patients and will assist \nbrain cancer researchers in their search for a cure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I offer my warmest congratulations to Ms. Madhavan and \nher team.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. VAN HOLLEN", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1539-E1540", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO SUBHASHREE MADHAVAN AND THE REMBRANDT PROJECT TEAM", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgE1539-5", "title": "TRIBUTE TO SUBHASHREE MADHAVAN AND THE REMBRANDT PROJECT TEAM"}
