{"content": [{"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H000338", "text": "  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, yesterday, President Bush fulfilled his \nconstitutional duty and nominated John Roberts to fill the vacancy left \nby Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. The spotlight is now on the Senate of the United States of \nAmerica. The President has done his duty, and now we need to do ours.\n  Let me first pay tribute to Justice O'Connor who has been a real \ntrailblazer in her own right. The first woman on the Supreme Court, a \nthoughtful and dedicated jurist, she has ably served on the highest \nCourt for the past nearly 24 years. Her announced retirement creates \nthe first vacancy in nearly 11 years. This has been the longest period \nwith the same set of Justices in more than 175 years.\n  Article II, section 2 of the Constitution says that the President \nalone nominates, but he appoints only with the advice and consent of \nthe Senate. One of the best shorthand ways of understanding the \nSenate's role is that by deciding whether to consent to the nomination, \nwe give the President advice about whether to appoint the person he has \nnominated. Traditionally, we have done so by means of an up-or-down \nvote on the Senate floor.\n  I commend the President and his team of senior advisers for broadly \nsoliciting the views of Senators and other interested parties. The \nPresident and his staff spoke with more than two-thirds of the Members \nof this body, over 70 Senators, an absolutely unprecedented level of \ninteraction.\n  For some, though, it appears that even extensive consultation with \nall 100 Senators would not be enough if they did not like the \nPresident's nominee. On the other hand, if they did like the nominee, I \nsuppose they would declare a 5-minute chat with a Senate staffer to \nhave been a consultative triumph.\n  No President need consult at all with any Senator or with anyone else \nfor that matter. The President does so because, in his judgment, it \nwill help him fulfill his constitutional responsibility. President Bush \nhas done that and has nominated John Roberts to be the 109th individual \nto serve on the Supreme Court in American history. The ball is now in \nour court.\n  Judge Roberts has served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit ever since we confirmed him on May 8, \n2003, without even a rollcall vote, I might add, one of the few people \nwho have ever been confirmed by unanimous consent on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Judge Roberts was so easily confirmed because he is so eminently \nqualified. He graduated summa cum laude from Harvard Law School and \nserved as managing editor of the Harvard Law Review--no small \nachievement. In other words, No. 1 in his class. He clerked for Judge \nHenry Friendly, one of the alltime great judges on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit, and then for Chief Justice William \nRehnquist on the U.S. Supreme Court, one of the alltime great Justices \non the Supreme Court.\n  Judge Roberts served as Special Assistant to the Attorney General, \nAssociate Counsel to President Ronald Reagan, and Principal Deputy \nSolicitor General under the first President Bush. And before his \njudicial appointment, he was head of the appellate practice group at \nthe distinguished law firm, internationally recognized, of Hogan & \nHartson.\n  He has been widely acknowledged as one of the most accomplished \nappellate attorneys in America, having argued nearly 40 cases before \nthe Supreme Court on a wide range of issues from antitrust and the \nfirst amendment to Indian law, bankruptcy, and labor law.\n  Not surprisingly, the American Bar Association unanimously gave Judge \nRoberts its highest well-qualified rating for his appeals court \nappointment. This has been the Democrats' gold standard for evaluating \njudicial nominees, and he has met every aspect of that standard.\n  The question now is how we should evaluate Judge Roberts' nomination \nto the Supreme Court and what standards we should apply. There is more \nconfusion about that than there should be. Yet I believe, like so many \nother endeavors, ending in the right place requires starting in the \nright place.\n  An effective process for hiring or selecting someone to fill a \nposition, any position, must start with an accurate description of that \nposition. I am reminded of a 1998 article by Judge Harry Edwards \nappointed in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the DC Circuit. I was in this body at the time. He was that \ncourt's chief judge from 1994 to 2001 and a colleague of Judge Roberts. \nJudge Edwards warned that giving the public a distorted view of what \njudges do is bad for both the judiciary and the rule of law.\n  The debate about judicial selection is a debate about what judges do, \nabout their proper place in our system of representative government. \nGetting the judicial job description right is necessary for a \nlegitimate and effective selection process. It defines the \nqualifications for the job. It identifies the criteria we should apply. \nIt guides the questions that may properly be asked and answered and the \nconclusions that should be reached.\n  Judges take law that they did not make and cannot change, determine \nwhat it means, and apply it to the facts of a legal dispute. That is \nwhat judges do. That judicial job description applies across the board. \nIt does not depend on the parties or the issues before the court. \nIt does not depend on the law that is involved in a particular case. \nAnd it certainly does not depend on which side wins or should win.\n\n  I believe we must help our fellow citizens better understand what \njudges do so they can better evaluate what we will be doing in the \nweeks ahead as we consider this nomination now before us.\n  Without in any way trivializing the work of judges, I want to use a \npractical example because I believe it can be simple without being \nsimplistic.\n  Judges are like umpires or referees. They are neutral officials who \ntake rules they did not make and cannot change and apply those rules to \na contest between two parties or multiple parties.\n  How would we evaluate the performance of an umpire or referee? Would \nwe say he or she did a good job as long as our favorite team won the \ngame? If we were hiring an umpire or referee, would we grill him or her \nabout which side he or she were likely to favor in the upcoming \nmatches? Of course not.\n  Desirable results neither justify an umpire or referee twisting the \nrules during the game nor are automatic proof that the umpire or \nreferee is fair and impartial. Umpires and referees must be fair and \nimpartial from beginning to end during the contest before them. They do \nnot pick the winner before the game starts, nor do they manipulate the \nprocess along the way to produce the winner they want.\n  In the same way, we must not evaluate judges solely by whether we \nlike their decisions or whether their decisions favor a particular \npolitical agenda. The political ends do not justify the judicial means.\n  This is a very important point, something we must keep in clear focus \nthroughout the weeks ahead. That is why I wanted to raise it now at the \nbeginning of the confirmation process.\n  One thing that is becoming increasingly clear is not everyone who \nsays\n\n\njudges must interpret but not make the law means the same thing. Some \nwho use that language still determine whether that standard is met the \nsame old way by whether a judge's decisions meet a litmus test.\n  Once again, an umpire or referee is not there to pick the winner. He \nor she is there to fairly and impartially apply the rules.\n  Similarly, judges are not there to pick the winner. They are there to \nfairly and impartially apply the law.\n  I emphasize this because it is at the heart of this entire debate \nover judicial selection, and I will be returning to it throughout this \nprocess.\n  We may like or dislike a judge's decision, but that is not the point. \nHis or her decisions may be consistent with certain political \ninterests, but that is not the point. That is not what judges do. It is \nnot their role in our system of representative government.\n  Rather, if the people do not like what the faithful and impartial \napplication of the law produces, then they and their elected \nrepresentatives can change the law.\n  That is our rule in our system of representative Government. \nExpecting judges to do our job--our legislative job--undermines the \njudicial branch and demeans the legislative branch. Simply put, judges \nmust be evaluated not by the results they reach but by the process they \nfollow to reach those results. That is what judges do.\n  Mark my words, we will hear in the days and weeks ahead this group or \nthat Senator demanding to know whether the nominee now before us would \nproduce the results they want or that they like. They want to know \nwhether the nominee will rule this way on this issue and that way on \nthis other issue. Some may try to cloak their mission, perhaps using \nterms their focus groups say will go down more smoothly with the \npublic. But we all know what is going on. They want to know which side \nthe umpire or referee will favor. They want to know that their team \nwill have an upper hand even before that team takes the field.\n  In recent days, we have heard speeches by Senators and seen letters \nby interest groups and law professors with lists of questions to ask \nthis nominee. Most of those questions are geared in one way or another \nto finding out how this nominee would likely rule; that is, the results \nthis nominee would likely deliver on certain issues.\n  Past nominees, including virtually every current member of the \nSupreme Court, have resisted such intrusive attempts to extract either \ncommitments or previews of future rulings. In that way, judicial \nnominees sometimes appear to have a deeper commitment to judicial \nindependence than some Senators.\n  I expect Judge Roberts will take a judicious approach to answering \nquestions, mindful of both the judicial position he already occupies \nand the one to which he has been nominated.\n  Last night, the head of one of the leftwing groups primed to attack \nJudge Roberts was on one of the cable talk shows as the news about the \nnomination circulated. It took him about 15 seconds to say the words, \n``serious problems,'' regarding this superbly qualified nominee.\n\n  Within minutes of the President's announcement last night, other \ngroups had already proclaimed the nominee an unacceptable extremist.\n  That kind of knee-jerk, results-oriented standard is wrong, whether \nsuch calls come from the left or the right.\n  As Judge Edwards reminded us, misrepresenting what judges do harms \nboth the judiciary and the rule of law.\n  Judges take law they did not make and cannot change, determine what \nthat law means, and apply it to settle legal disputes. That is what \njudges do.\n  In the days and weeks ahead, let us keep that job description in mind \nand set about determining whether the nominee now before us can do that \njob.\n  Judge Roberts twice came before the Judiciary Committee. As a matter \nof fact, he had to wait 14 years to finally be confirmed by the Senate. \nHe was nominated by George Herbert Walker Bush, Bush 1, and then \nrenominated by Bush 2, George W. Bush. But I remember him when he came \nbefore the committee. We had two hearings for him. I remember him as an \nintelligent, fair-minded, and thoughtful person, and so does everybody \nelse who knows him.\n  While I, of course, must withhold final judgment on Judge Roberts' \nnomination to the Supreme Court until after the confirmation hearing, \nmy initial reaction is President Bush appears to have submitted to the \nSenate a well-qualified nominee with the kind of intellect, integrity, \nand independence that is required for a Supreme Court Justice.\n  We must apply the right standard as we evaluate this nominee.\n  Having said all of that, I understand Senators are saying they can \nask any question they want, and I have said Senators on the Judiciary \nCommittee can ask any question they want, no matter how stupid the \nquestion may be. And we have all asked stupid questions from time to \ntime, I am sure. At least most of us have. But the judge does not have \nto answer those questions. In fact, under the Canons of Judicial \nEthics, judges should not be opining or answering questions about \nissues that may possibly come before them in the future.\n  I would like this body to remember some past nominations, and I will \ncite with particularity the nomination of Antonin Scalia to become a \nJustice on the U.S. Supreme Court. I remember time after time Senators \nasking him questions about how he might rule in the future on various \nissues, including Roe v. Wade. He refused to answer those questions \nbecause he thought those issues might come before him as a Justice on \nthe Supreme Court and, frankly, wanted to abide by the Canons of \nJudicial Ethics. He was not overly pressured. The Judiciary Committee \ntreated him with respect. He passed through the Senate 100 to zip and, \nof course, has become one of the leading conservative jurists in the \nhistory of the Court. But he did not have to answer questions that \nasked for specific conclusions in areas that likely would come before \nthe Court, and that is almost anything. In this day and age, there is \nso much litigation almost anything could come before the Court.\n  The second illustration is the Ruth Bader Ginsburg illustration. Ruth \nBader Ginsburg, when she came before the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nrefused to answer questions with regard to matters that might come \nbefore her if she would be confirmed as a Justice to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  Our side did not overly press her to answer those questions. We did \nnot scream and shout about, She has to answer my questions or I am not \ngoing to vote for her. We did not make demands on her that were \ninappropriate. We did not have outside groups giving us questions to \nask that are outrageous and formed for the purpose of trying to scuttle \nthe nomination. She took that position, and we honored her in taking \nthat position.\n  If I recall it correctly, she passed through the Senate I believe 96 \nto 3. We knew that she was a social liberal. We conservatives who are \npro-life knew she was pro-abortion. We knew that she differed with our \nside on many issues. We also knew that she was qualified, and we knew \nshe deserved a vote up or down out of respect for the position, out of \nrespect for the U.S. Supreme Court, and out of respect for her. She \nreceived her vote up or down, and there was not a lot of screaming and \nshouting about it, nor were there threats made, nor were there threats \nthat we might someday filibuster her if she did not agree with the \nresults we wanted her to rule on in advance.\n  That is what is going on, and it has been going on ever since the \nRehnquist nomination for Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. It \nhas only gone on on one side, and that is the Democrat side, in a \nseries of very embarrassing Supreme Court nomination proceedings, \nstarting with Justice Rehnquist. Why, some even violated the law and \nput out some of his medical records that were highly confidential.\n  When Bob Bork came up, it was unmitigated the way they treated him. \nEven Justice Souter was mistreated because they thought he might \npossibly be pro-life. Justice Kennedy was not as mistreated as the \nothers, but they were very concerned because they thought he might be \npro-life. In fact, even Justice O'Connor when she came to the floor had \nher critics on both sides because they were afraid she might be one way \nor the other on Roe v. Wade. The fact is, we now know where Justice \nO'Connor, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Souter are on these issues, but \nwe\n\n\ndid not know at the time, nor do we know where to-be Justice Roberts is \non these issues as well. Nobody has asked him those questions and \nnobody should because those questions are all hot-button issues that \nmay come before the Supreme Court.\n  If there has ever been anybody qualified to go on the Supreme Court, \none would have to say John Roberts meets every requisite standard to be \nconfirmed as a Justice on the Supreme Court. This is a brilliant man. \nThis is an honest man with a sense of humor. This is a leading \nappellate advocate. He has held responsible positions in Government. He \nhas risen to the top of the legal profession. He has the highest \nrecommendation of the American Bar Association for the circuit court of \nappeals seat. He is one of the great legal thinkers of America. How he \nwill rule on various issues I, frankly, do not know. I believe him to \nbe conservative. The President said he would appoint only \nconservatives, which is his right. That is what one gets when they vote \nfor President.\n  If I have ever seen anybody who deserves being on the Court more than \nJohn Roberts, I have to think pretty hard. John Roberts is a fine man. \nI hope he will be treated with great respect and deference, and I hope \nthese very partisan, very nasty groups from the left and maybe even the \nright pack up their tents and go home because they do not belong in \nthis process the way they are acting, though in a free country they can \nact that way, and I would fight for their right to do so. We should not \nbe influenced by that type of inappropriate, prejudgmental approach to \nSupreme Court nominees.\n  I believe John Roberts will become a Justice on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, I hope expeditiously, certainly before the first Monday in \nOctober so that the Court can have a full complement. I believe the \nSenate will overwhelmingly support him, and I hope that is the case. If \nit is not, then we are going to have to reexamine the way things go \naround here.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. HATCH", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to briefly discuss the \nnomination of Judge John Roberts and commend the President for \nsubmitting for our consideration a superbly qualified nominee who has \nthe requisite background and experience to serve the Nation well as the \nnext Justice of the Supreme Court. Indeed, I think the President, after \nhearing advice from a whole host of different areas, simply decided to \nappoint the best person he found in America. That is what he did. I am \nproud of him. I think it is the right thing to do, and I believe this \nwill be proven out as time goes by.\n  I don't know John Roberts personally, but I do know his record. I \nstudied it 2 years ago when this Senate provided its unanimous advice \nand consent to place him in his current position on the District of \nColumbia Circuit Court of Appeals. We did so with the knowledge that \nthe D.C. Circuit in many instances has served as the launching pad for \nSupreme Court nominees. So I hope this process will be conducted with \ndignity and respect and that we will be able to have him in place \nbefore the Supreme Court convenes in October.\n  We considered his record then in great detail. People were heard \nfrom; people submitted information. In fact, 152 lawyers wrote in \nsupport of him. But he was looked at hard then. Only three people voted \nagainst him in the committee, and he was unanimously confirmed in this \nChamber.\n  A Supreme Court Jurist should have high standards. He or she should \nbe committed to the rule of law and to resist the temptation to \nlegislate from the bench. He or she should believe in the Constitution \nand adhere to the provisions provided in that great document regardless \nof whether he or she believes personally that those are correct. They \ndo not have to agree with the provisions. They didn't write the \nprovisions. They were written by ``we the people'' of the United States \nof America.\n  I participated in that hearing 2 years ago, and he gave the committee \na commitment that he would not carry a political agenda to the D.C. \nCircuit, that he would adhere to the law rather than follow politics. \nAnd over the last 2 years as a judge on the D.C. Circuit he has \nfulfilled that commitment. So I think and hope that he is off to a good \nstart in this process.\n  Make no mistake about it, Senators will have some questions, and \nhaving witnessed Mr. Roberts' eloquent testimony and principled \napproach to jurisprudence during his last hearing, I know he will have \nthe answers to those questions. He very simply won Senators over during \nhis last hearing, and this is why I believe he was confirmed with a \nstrong vote. I am sure the results will be the same this year.\n  The Senate must treat the nominee fairly and have a fair and \ndignified process. Converting legal disagreements into personal attacks \non the nominees as we have seen in the past in recent years is not \nappropriate. It is beneath the dignity of the Senate. It is not proper, \nand it should not be done. In many instances nominees have been \nunfairly personally attacked for simply following the law as they saw \nit.\n  So I am concerned about a fair process, not so much from the Members \nof our Senate--hopefully, that will not occur this time--but from some \nof the hard left attack groups.\n  A few weeks ago this cartoon appeared in the paper, and I would like \nto refer to it. I think it is a bit humorous, but I agree it raised a \nlot of money. It says: Don't let Bush nominate this rightwing extremist \nnut to the Supreme Court. And then leaves blank the name. So he hasn't \nnominated anybody yet, but they have already raised their money and \nlaid the game plan to attack whoever comes up as being some extremist \nrightwing nut. I think that is pretty interesting. They say here we \nwill plug the photo in as soon as we find out who it is.\n  I believe we have another one that I think is also humorous, but it \nhas a lot of truth in it. It says: We're here to voice our strongest \nopposition to the Bush Supreme Court nominee--whoever he may be.\n  That is where we are. A lot of money has been raised by groups. For \nthe first time I think, Mr. President, conservative groups, or groups \nthat tend to support the President's nominees raise money, too, so we \nmight have activity on both sides. That has not been the case in the \npast.\n  We laugh at these little cartoons and they are not a perfect truth, \nbut they have some truth in them. But last night the NOW group \nannounced right after the nomination that the President had nominated \nan anti-Roe judge and that the lives of women in America were at stake. \nThe People for the American Way contend that Judge Roberts' record does \nnot demonstrate a fundamental commitment to civil and constitutional \nrights. And other complaints have been raised about him before the ink \nwas dry on the nomination. So I hope that instead of buying into these \ngroups' broken records--the same charges that are paraded out every \ntime a Bush nominee is submitted--we will study Judge Roberts' record \nand have a fair process and consider what scholars in this country are \nsaying--practicing lawyers, judges with whom he practiced and before \nwhom he practiced. These are objective observers. Many of them are \nDemocrats. They will provide far more valid insight than hard left \ngroups such as MoveOn.Org or People for the American Way.\n\n  This is what we know about Judge Roberts so far. He has a keen \nintellect, sound legal judgment, and the highest level of integrity. He \ngraduated from Harvard college in 3 years summa cum laude and the \nHarvard Law School where he served as managing editor of the Harvard \nLaw Review. And, of course, serving on the law review at a law school \nis a great honor, and to be an editor or managing editor of that law \nreview is one of the highest honors any graduating senior can be given \nby his peers who elect him to that position.\n  After graduating from law school, he clerked for one of the most \nesteemed and respected jurists in the country, Judge Henry J. Friendly \non the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, and then went on to \nclerk with Chief Justice William Rehnquist on the U.S.\n\n\nSupreme Court, the very Court he has now been nominated to serve on. He \nhas clerked for the Chief Justice of the United States. He sat there at \nhis right hand. He has helped him develop and write the opinions and do \nthe research that goes into rendering an opinion. As a result, he has \nhad very good experience for that position. I am sure there are perhaps \nmany, hundreds perhaps, lawyers who would love to serve as Judge Henry \nFriendly's law clerk. There would be thousands that apply before the \nfew are selected to clerk on the U.S. Supreme Court. Why? Because they \nselect only the best. They select candidates who have high academic \nrecords and proven public integrity. So he served in the White House \ncounsel's office, served as the Principal Deputy Solicitor General to \nthe United States Department of Justice. The Solicitor General is the \nGovernment's lawyer to the courts of America, the appellate courts.\n  The Solicitor General's office sends the lawyers into the U.S. \nSupreme Court to stand up in that Court and represent the United \nStates. I was a U.S. attorney, and in the U.S. district court in \nMobile, AL, it was my honor and pleasure on a regular basis to stand \nbefore the U.S. district judge and say, ``The United States is ready, \nYour Honor.'' To represent the United States of America in court is a \ngreat honor. To represent the United States of America in the greatest \nCourt in the history of the world, the U.S. Supreme Court, is a great \nhonor. As the Principal Deputy Solicitor General, that is what he did \non a regular basis.\n  Prior to assuming his current position, he was known as probably the \nmost respected appellate lawyer in the United States, having argued 39 \ncases before the U.S. Supreme Court. When you have an important case, \nyou want the best lawyer in America to represent you in the Supreme \nCourt, and he was selected time and again by people to represent them \nin this highest Court, which is, indeed, a high compliment. His \nexperience goes beyond what I have described here. He practiced in one \nof the Nation's top law firms and has extensive government experience. \nThe American Bar Association, which rates judge nominees--they go out \nand interview people who have litigated for them, litigated against \nthem, judges before whom they practice, and they evaluate how fine that \nnominee is. They have just a few levels of recommendation, but the best \none, ``well-qualified,'' is reserved for a small number. Judge Roberts \nwas given the highest rating of the American Bar Association to serve \nin his current position, and I would not be surprised if he doesn't get \nit for the Supreme Court.\n  So I hope we will give him a fair process, that we will avoid \nestablishing a litmus test. However, it does concern me that one Member \nhas already said, ``We need to know where John Roberts is on the \nissues, whose side he's on.''\n  Well, you can't demand that a judge be on your side as a price for \nconfirmation. What do we mean, whose side they are on? What do we mean? \nWhose side are they are on? By definition, a judge is a person who is \nunbiased, a neutral referee, a person who treats everyone respectfully \nand then follows the law in a dispassionate, disinterested manner. That \nis why we give them a lifetime appointment.\n\n  We cannot go down this road asking judges, nominees, to commit to a \nspecific decision or to promise to be favorable to one view or another \nthat a certain Senator may have. What kind of disaster would that be? \nIt would invade the independence of the judiciary. Judges have to be \nneutral arbiters. They are not to call the balls and strikes before the \npitches are thrown, for Heaven's sake. We must not require him or \ndemand of him that he state how he expects to decide cases. That \nviolates the independence of the judiciary.\n  What I will ask him to do is to demonstrate a fidelity to the law, a \ncommitment not to legislate from the bench, and to leave the \nlegislation to the Congress and the State. He has demonstrated that \nover time.\n  The President has made a very wise decision. This nominee, from his \npast performance in the Judiciary Committee, has shown poise, good \njudgment, and a clear ability to articulate important issues to the \nSenators in an effective way that has won their respect. I am excited \nfor him.\n  I also am pleased to note he was chosen to be captain of his high \nschool football team. I will say this: They do not elect flakes to be \ncaptain of the football team. These are people who players have seen \nand worked with under difficult circumstances, and they respected him \nenough to choose him. He will be an outstanding member of the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  This Senate will be tested. Will we be objective? Will we be fair? \nWill we give this incredibly superb nominee the fair and just hearing \nto which he is entitled?\n", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. SESSIONS", "itemno": 5}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 6}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "S8584-S8587", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "NOMINATION OF JOHN ROBERTS", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgS8584", "title": "NOMINATION OF JOHN ROBERTS"}
