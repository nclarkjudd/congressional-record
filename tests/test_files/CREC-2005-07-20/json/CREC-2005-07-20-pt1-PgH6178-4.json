Madam Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 31st \nanniversary of the 1974 illegal Turkish invasion of Cyprus.\n  I have commemorated this day each year since I became a Member of \nCongress. PSEKA, the International Coordinating Committee, Justice for \nCyrus, the Cyprus Federation of America, the World Council of Hellenes \nAbroad, the Federation of Hellenic Societies are all located in the \n14th Congressional District of New York, which I am fortunate to \nrepresent.\n  These organizations believe that peace will come to Cyprus, and they \nhave been strong advocates against the division of Cyprus and the human \nrights violations perpetrated by the Turkish army in Cyprus. While we \nmust remember this black anniversary, we also need to look to the \nfuture. Cyprus' accession to the European Union was an historic \nachievement. As an EU member, Cyprus represents European values and \npolicies, and at the same time is working toward even stronger \ntransatlantic ties with the United States.\n  This was a long time in coming, and I believe that Cyprus has much to \ncontribute to the EU. Although all of us,\n\n\nincluding the Greek Cypriots and Turkey Cypriots, want to see the \ndivision of Cyprus end before its entrance into the EU, the Annan plan \nfor a Cyprus settlement was justly voted down by the Greek Cypriots by \nan overwhelming 76 percent.\n  My colleague, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), \noutlined the many reasons why this vote took place.\n\n\n  But we have also heard that many of the residents are working to \nresolve these disputes and that there is growing strength for a unified \nCyprus. A unified Cyprus would promote stability both politically and \neconomically to the entire Mediterranean region. The people of Cyprus \ndeserve a unified and democratic country, and I remain hopeful that a \npeaceful settlement will be found so that the division of Cyprus will \ncome to an end. Some of us are calling for a special envoy to Cyprus to \nwork towards achieving that end.\n  However, there have been recent developments that concern me, and I \nknow that they may concern many of my colleagues. Earlier this month, \nthe gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) and I sent a letter, along \nwith 30 other Members of this body, to Secretary of State Rice asking \nfor clarification about U.S. policy toward Cyprus. Specifically, we are \nseeking answers about the policy of the United States regarding travel \ndirectly into the northern occupied parts of Cyprus by U.S. citizens.\n  While we have not yet heard from the Secretary, I remain hopeful that \nour relations with Cyprus will remain steadfast and that we will \ncontinue to adhere to international treaties and U.N. Security Council \nresolutions on this issue.\n  I also want to mention the ongoing issue in Cyprus over property in \nthe northern part of the island. Since Turkey invaded Cyprus, American \ncitizens have been denied access to their property even though they \nhold titles to that property. I urge my colleagues to support \nlegislation offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), \nH.R. 857, the American-Owned Property in Occupied Cyprus Claims Act, \nwhich would enable U.S. citizens who own property in the Turkish-\noccupied territory of the Republic of Cyprus to seek financial remedies \nwith either the current inhabitants of their land or the Turkish \nGovernment.\n  Additionally, I have introduced a resolution, H.R. 322, which \nexpresses the sense of the House of Representatives in support of the \nEuropean Court of Human Rights for its decision in the Loizidou v. \nTurkey and the Xenides-Arestis v. Turkey cases and for admitting \nsimilar cases before the court.\n  The European Court of Human Rights in 1996 ruled that Turkey must pay \nTitina Loizidou for denying her access to her property in the occupied \npart of Cyprus. Earlier this year the European Court of Human Rights \ndecided that a similar case brought by Xenides-Arestis against Turkey \nwas admissible and that Turkey continues to be responsible for what \nhappens in the occupied areas of Cyprus since Turkey exercises \neffective and overall control through the presence of over 30,000 \ntroops in northern Cyprus.\n  While I hope that Turkey respects the decisions made by the European \nCourt of Human Rights, I believe that denying property owners access to \ntheir land in northern Cyprus is wrong and that steps should be taken \nimmediately to address this issue. Thirty-one years is too long to have \na divided country. It is too long to be kept from one's home. It is too \nlong to be separated from one's family. We have seen many tremendous \nchanges around the world. It is time for Cyprus to live in peace and \nsecurity with full enjoyment of their human rights.\n  In recognition of the spirit of the people of Cyprus, I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in commemorating the 31st anniversary of the \ninvasion of Cyprus. Long live freedom. Long live Cyprus. Long live \nGreece. And long live the United States and the friendship between our \ncountries.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mrs. MALONEY", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6178-H6179", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "109", "number": "322"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "109", "number": "857"}], "doc_title": "31ST ANNIVERSARY OF TURKISH INVASION OF CYPRUS", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6178-4"}
