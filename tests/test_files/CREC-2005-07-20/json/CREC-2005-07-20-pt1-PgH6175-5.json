Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the U.S.-\nDominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement. Today, the \nUnited States and the five DR-CAFTA countries already enjoy a strong \neconomic relationship. This FTA will only enhance that relationship by \nopening markets and integrating economies.\n  Under the agreement, more than four-fifths of total U.S. exports to \nthe six DR-CAFTA countries will receive immediate duty-free treatment. \nAmerican farmers and manufacturers would benefit from the increased \naccess and competitive advantage that duty-free treatment provides.\n  But this FTA covers much more than trade and goods. Today, services \nare an integral part of the U.S. economy. Under the DR-CAFTA, the \nCentral American countries will open their markets to U.S. services \ncompanies. In many cases, the agreement allows U.S. banking, insurance, \ntelecommunications, and other services companies to compete in markets \nthat were once dominated by state-endorsed monopolies.\n  In addition, the FTA will put U.S. service providers at an advantage \nover their foreign competitors who do not have access to these six \ngrowing economies.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider how CAFTA will benefit U.S. \ncompanies and vote to support this very important piece of legislation.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. HERGER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6175", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "SERVICES TRADE", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6175-5", "title": "SERVICES TRADE"}
