Mr. Speaker, I stand here in strong support of the \nDominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement, a trade \nagreement that is a win-win for Illinois farmers, Illinois \nmanufacturers, and Illinois workers that currently trades one way with \nCentral America and the Caribbean.\n  In Illinois 40 percent of our farm production is exported, where \nright now under the Caribbean Basin Initiative 99 percent of the \nCaribbean and Central American farm products enter the United States \nduty-free, where Illinois corn faces a 20 percent tariff, Illinois \nsoybeans face a 30 percent tariff, Illinois pork faces a 40 percent \ntariff. And, frankly, with DR-CAFTA we essentially wipe out those \ntariffs on Illinois products.\n  When it comes to manufacturing there are 151,000 jobs in my State \ndependent on exports; and under the current status quo 80 percent of \nmanufactured goods, textiles for example, from the Caribbean and \nCentral America enter Illinois and the United States duty-free while \nmanufacturing goods from my district, apparel, textiles, bulldozers \nface tariffs of 14 percent up to 20 percent. Again, under DR-CAFTA \nthose tariffs are eliminated immediately.\n  The status quo is not good for farmers. The status quo is not good \nfor manufacturers because under the current status quo our products \ngoing to Central America, exported to Central America, suffer tariffs. \nTheirs come in duty-free.\n  Let us make this trade a two-way street. Vote yes for CAFTA. Help \nmanufacturers, help farmers eliminate those duties on our products.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. WELLER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6174", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "TWO-WAY STREET", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6174", "title": "TWO-WAY STREET"}
