Mr. Speaker, God's whisper to come on home to Brenda \n[Brenda Pillors], our sister in service and life, on the frontlines in \nthe battles and opportunities to improve life and health for all, came \non June 12, 2005.\n  It is with honor that I present this special tribute in memory of our \noutstanding colleague and dear friend, Brenda Pillors, Chief of Staff \nto Congressman Ed Towns. Today, July 20th marks what would have been a \ncelebration of Brenda's earthly birthday. Colleagues, family and \nfriends know personally that Brenda did so very, very much to improve \nthe lives and the quality thereof for people everywhere and across all \nwalks of life.\n  Brenda's impact on health legislation, policy and all other aspects \nthereof remains from that on minority health and health disparities, to \nhealth professions, to children's and women's health; from Medicare and \nMedicaid, to healthcare reform, to health commissions and agency \nadvisory councils, to the National Health Service Corps; from NIH, to \nFDA, to SAMHSA, to CDC, to HRSA, to AHRQ, to OMH, to OCR, to IOM; for \nHIV/AIDS, to diabetes, to obesity, to sickle cell disease, to cancer, \nto heart disease; from clinical trials, to life trials; from \nbioengineering, to health technology, to alternative medicine; from \nbehavioral health, to workforce diversity, to affirmative action.\n  Brenda Pillors was always there--from pharmacology, to immunology, to \nvaccines; from hospitals, to community health centers, to men's health; \nfrom environmental health, to health justice, to nutrition, to birth \ndefects; from the uninsured and underinsured, to urban and rural \nhealth; from infant mortality, to head start, to mental health; from \nnurses, to doctors, to specialists, to community health workers, to \nresearchers; to private and public sector officials; from you to me. \nHer impact goes on and on--you know Brenda's tremendous heart, impact \nand reach.\n  We will always remember you Brenda--your dedication, your commitment, \nyour leadership, your expertise and your understanding, and indeed your \nsmile, your laughter and your voice. Brenda Pillors--truly a leader in \npublic service and servant in God's army of service and love.\n  My ``Sister,'' we will miss you always--your legacy of achievements \nis written in the hearts of the lives of those you have helped and \ntouched in oh so many, many ways. Your presence and legacy is embedded \nin the walls and along the halls of the U.S. Congress, and is written \nin legislation, Congressional hearing questions and transcripts, \nhearing reports, committee and conference reports, agency reports and \njustifications, and throughout the Congressional Record.\n  Brenda was and truly lived the ``purpose driven life.'' Thousands, \nupon thousands, upon thousands, upon thousands of lives have been \nimproved and in fact many saved, and futures are much brighter because \nof Brenda's life and works. The majority of the people who have and \nwill benefit from her works will never know her. Even the lives of \ngenerations to come will benefit from her work. We have always been \nproud of Brenda.\n  Dear Brenda, we thank you, and we salute you and we honor you--our \n``sister in service striving throughout her life to ensure justice and \nequality for all--Brenda Pillors, PhD.''\n  Reflections of our love, appreciation and respect for Brenda Pillors, \non this day which would have marked her 53rd birthday. From me to you, \nwe thank God and your family for sharing you with us, the Nation and \nthe world--Fredette (Fredette West).\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. TOWNS", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 4}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1543", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "SPECIAL TRIBUTE IN MEMORY OF BRENDA PILLORS, PHD (JULY 20, 1952-JUNE 12, 2005)", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgE1543-2", "title": "SPECIAL TRIBUTE IN MEMORY OF BRENDA PILLORS, PHD (JULY 20, 1952-JUNE"}
