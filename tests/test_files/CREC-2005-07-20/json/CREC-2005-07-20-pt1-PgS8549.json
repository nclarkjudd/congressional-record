Mr. President, I am pleased to commend \nCentennial High School in Howard County, MD, for its fine performance \non this year's ``It's Academic'' quiz show. After many hours of \npractice and four rounds of competition, Centennial has emerged as the \n2004-2005 Baltimore-area ``It's Academic'' champion.\n  The team of Jeff Amoros, Michael Fasulo, Marin Lolic, and Seth \nManoff, with the assistance of their coach John Cheek, took first place \nout of 81 teams that competed from both public and private schools \nacross the State of Maryland. In its final match, Centennial defeated \ntwo formidable foes in Calvert Hall College High School and Oakland \nMills High School.\n  ``It's Academic'', which is telecast every Saturday morning during \nthe school year on WJZ-TV, channel 13, has been quizzing Maryland \nstudents since 1961. In fact, according to the ``2005 Guinness Book of \nWorld Records'', it is the world's longest running quiz show. For \nMaryland students, ``It's Academic'' provides an opportunity to \nchallenge not only their own knowledge of math, science, literature, \ngovernment and history, but also how their knowledge stacks up against \nstudents around the State. This year, Centennial's team demonstrated \nenormous skill and erudition. Congratulations to Jeff, Michael, Marin, \nSeth and Coach Cheek on a wonderful accomplishment.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SARBANES", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "S8549", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "HONORING CENTENNIAL HIGH SCHOOL", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgS8549", "title": "HONORING CENTENNIAL HIGH SCHOOL"}
