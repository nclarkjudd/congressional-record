Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nH. Res. 328, and I rise on behalf of the more than 111,000 of my \nconstituents who are of Polish descent to recognize the 25th \nanniversary of the workers' strikes in Poland in 1980. These strikes \npressured the government to recognize the Solidarity Trade Union and, \neventually, to enact fundamental changes in the government in Poland. \nIt is my privilege to join with Poland, friends of Poland and people of \nPolish descent around the world in honoring this historic date.\n  The summer of 1980 was a turbulent time in Poland. Soviet domination \nresulted not only in political oppression but in deep economic crisis. \nIn response to these conditions, workers were striking in several \ncities across the country. In 1979, the visit by Pope John II added to \nthe hope and desire of all Polish people for change and demonstrated \nthe possibility of mass independent movements.\n  The Independent and Self-Governing Solidarity Trade Union was \nestablished as a result of the Gdansk Accords signed on August 31, 1980 \nbetween striking workers and the communist government. In this \nagreement the government conceded to striking workers' requests and \nallowed them to form free trade unions, independent from the government \nand communist party, an unprecedented situation under the Iron Curtain.\n  By signing the accords the communist government hoped to appease \nworkers while entrenching their power. To the government's great \ndisappointment, the Solidarity Trade Union grew rapidly. By 1981, \nSolidarity boasted an unparalleled membership of nearly 10 million \nworkers or more than a half of the Polish labor force and almost one \nthird of the entire population. Employees from all sectors of economy \nand positions joined en masse, including workers, professionals, \nintellectuals, students and members of political opposition. The \nSolidarity Trade Union became a huge social and political movement, \nrepresenting the Polish nation's aspirations for freedom, democracy and \nbetter living conditions after more than thirty-five years of communism \nand Soviet control.\n\n  However, the road to freedom was not easy. Seeing how popular and \npowerful the union was becoming, the communist government of Poland \nimposed Martial Law in 1981, followed by persecution, imprisonment and \nforced emigration of many Solidarity members, including Lech Walesa. \nNonetheless, the banned Solidarity Trade Union kept aggravating both \nwithin Poland and abroad with the instrumental support of Pope John \nPaul II.\n  In 1989, the will of millions prevailed: the communist government \ngave in and held talks with the Solidarity Trade Union. These ``round \ntable negotiations'' resulted in free elections to the National \nAssembly, won almost completely by candidates supported by the \nSolidarity Trade Union. Subsequently, the noncommunist prime minister \nwas elected later that year, and in 1990, Lech Walesa, a former worker-\nelectrician and the leader of the Solidarity Trade Union who had been \ninstrumental in workers' strikes of 1980 and in the Gdansk Accords, \nbecame the first elected president of the newly non-communist Poland. \nCommunism was peacefully overthrown.\n  Within a year, following the Polish example, the regimes in the Czech \nRepublic, Hungary and East Germany had fallen. By 1991, communism was \noverthrown throughout Europe thanks to the inspiration of the \nSolidarity Trade Union.\n  With its long and rich history and traditions, Poland regained its \nrightful place among free and independent nations, first as a \ncontributing partner in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, \nand last year, as a full member of the European Union. Today, Poland\n\n\ncontinues to be our staunch ally and steadfast friend in Europe in our \nfight against terrorism.\n  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my 111,000 Polish American constituents, I \nam honored to recognize this important anniversary and honor the events \nin Poland 25 years ago that helped restore freedom and democracy in \nPoland and throughout Europe.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. EMANUEL", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1547-E1548", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HRES", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "109", "number": "328"}], "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SOLIDARITY MOVEMENT IN POLAND", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgE1547-3"}
