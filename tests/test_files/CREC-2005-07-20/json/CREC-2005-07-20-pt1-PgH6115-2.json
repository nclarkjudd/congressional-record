Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House this morning in \nsupport of House Concurrent Resolution 202. This is a bill authorizing \nthe use of the Rotunda of the United States Capitol for a ceremony on \nJuly 26 honoring Constantino Brumidi on the 200th anniversary of his \nbirthday.\n  On June 22, 2005, President Bush issued a proclamation which honored \nand celebrated the 200th anniversary of the birth of Constantino \nBrumidi. That is the action that brings us here today, to permit a \nceremony in Constantino Brumidi's honor to be held in the Capitol \nRotunda.\n  Constantino Brumidi has been called the Michelangelo of the United \nStates Capitol Building. House Concurrent Resolution 202 was introduced \nboth to honor the life and also the work of Constantino Brumidi, who \nwas an Italian immigrant also with strong family Hellenic roots who \nspent some 25 years, from 1855 to 1880, painting, decorating, and \nenhancing the beauty of our United States Capitol building. Brumidi was \nborn in Italy in 1805 and he worked as an artist in Rome and the \nVatican where he had many commissions, including a portrait of Pope \nPius IX. In 1852, Brumidi immigrated to the United States and he \ndedicated the balance of his life to making our Capitol building one of \nthe most impressive structures in this great Nation and really in the \nworld.\n  In 1865, Brumidi spent some 11 months walking dangerously high atop \nthe Capitol Rotunda laboring on his masterpiece which if you go to the \ncenter of the Rotunda and look up, you see his famous work entitled \n``The Apotheosis of Washington,'' in the eye of the Capitol dome. Six \nyears later, he created the first tribute to an African American in the \nCapitol when he placed the figure of Crispus Attucks at the center of \nthe painting which memorializes and pays tribute to those patriots who \nwere lost in the Boston Massacre.\n  In 1878 at the age of 72 and in poor health, Brumidi began his final \nwork and that was on the Rotunda frieze around the edge of the center \nof the Capitol dome. That frieze chronicles the history of the United \nStates.\n  Constantino Brumidi's life and work exemplifies the life of really \nmillions of immigrants who came to the United States to seek \nopportunity and to seek freedom in America. Brumidi and many others who \nimmigrated to the United States provided their skills and their hard \nwork, and they bettered their lives and they bettered the lives of \ntheir children, their grandchildren, and their great grandchildren, \nmany who serve in this Congress, many who serve across this land and \nwhose daily lives enrich every day the United States of America.\n  NAIF, the National Italian-American Foundation, is an organization \nwhich promotes American and Italian relations, cultural and business \nrelations and numerous other U.S. Italian groups that support this \neffort to recognize the outstanding work of Constantino Brumidi.\n  Constantino Brumidi is now part of the ages. He is deceased. However, \nhis great artistic contributions all around us in this United States \nCapitol live on and give both beauty and also life, continuing life, to \nour Nation's Capitol building.\n  Mr. Speaker, 2005 is the bicentennial of Brumidi's birth, and I can \nthink of no better way to honor this patriotic Italian-American's \ncontribution to our great Nation than by passing this resolution.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. MICA", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M000714", "text": "  Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution \n202 authorizing use of the Rotunda for a ceremony on July 26, 2005, to \ncommemorate the 200th anniversary of the birth\nof a noted Italian-American artist, Constantino Brumidi.\n  Brumidi was in many ways a classic American success story. Born in \nRome to Italian and Greek parents in 1805, he began preparing for an \nartistic career at age 13 by studying with distinguished sculptors and \npainters. Much of his artistic vision was based on the wall paintings \nof ancient Rome and Pompeii, and on studies of the Renaissance and the \nBaroque. He focused on work for the Catholic Church, including several \nPopes, Italian princes, and other wealthy patrons.\n  Forced to immigrate to the United States in 1852 from an Italy \nwracked by political turmoil, he became an American citizen in 1867 and \nestablished himself as a creator of historic frescoes and murals. \nBeginning in 1855 and lasting until his death in 1880, Brumidi is known \ntoday primarily for the murals he painted in a changing U.S. Capitol \nbuilding over a 25-year period.\n  His training was well suited in the classical design of the Capitol \nbuilding. These works of art lure the eyes of visitors upward towards \nsights of beauty, in addition to the historic design of the Capitol \nitself, as they wander through examples of his artistry in the Capitol \nRotunda, committee rooms, and what has become known as the Brumidi \ncorridors on the first floor of the Senate wing of the building.\n  Brumidi also accepted private commissions and periodically returned \nto his specialty of religious paintings for the Catholic Church which \nhe had practiced extensively earlier in his career.\n  Brumidi's worked on decorations in hallways and rooms throughout the \nCapitol and in the Hall of the House of\n\n\nRepresentatives and in the Capitol dome, which symbolizes the center of \nAmerican democracy. His murals combine classical and allegorical \nsubjects with portraits and scenes from American history and tributes \nto American values and inventions. His work on the monumental canopy, \ncalled ``The Apotheosis of George Washington'' in the newly constructed \ndome remained incomplete at his death in 1880, but the dome frieze was \nultimately concluded in 1953. Other artists continued to work on his \nunfinished projects.\n  Brumidi's works are so admired that even in a constantly changing, \ncrowded building where additional rooms for staff are created out of \ncorridors which contain Brumidi's work, efforts are made to ensure that \nthe walls and ceilings remain available to public viewing through \ntransparent partitions.\n  Mr. Speaker, Constantino Brumidi has deservedly been called ``the \nMichelangelo of the Capitol.'' His legacy was recently chronicled and \nevaluated in a richly detailed 1998 book by Dr. Barbara A. Wolanin, \ncurator for the Architect of the Capitol and published by the U.S. \nGovernment Printing Office.\n  It is fitting in another period of major change of the U.S. Capitol \nbuilding with the anticipated completion of the U.S. Visitor Center in \n2007, we honor Brumidi's lasting contributions.\n  I want to commend the sponsors of this concurrent resolution, the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), the gentleman from Florida \n(Mr. Bilirakis), the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney) and the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica) for taking this initiative as well as \nthe gentleman from New York (Mr. Israel), who has sought a Presidential \nproclamation honoring Constantino Brumidi.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 3, "speaker": "Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M000689", "text": "  Mr. MICA.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. \nMica) for taking the lead on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I too rise today to support H. Con. Res. 202, a \nresolution permitting the use of the Capitol Rotunda for a ceremony to \nhonor Constantino Brumidi on the 200th anniversary of his birth.\n  To some Brumidi is known only as the artist of the Capitol. However, \nto many others he is much more. With his astonishing allegorical art \nwork, Brumidi links the birthplace of democracy, ancient Greece, to the \nworld's newest land of liberty, America. Moreover, Brumidi himself \nrepresents what his masterpieces convey. As a political refugee, \nBrumidi illustrates the principles upon which this great Nation was \nfounded: Freedom, liberty and opportunity.\n  On July 26, 1805, Constantino Brumidi was born in Rome to a Greek \nfather and an Italian mother. He spent his childhood studying at the \nmost prestigious art school in the city and quickly became a renowned \nartist, receiving a commission to work at the Vatican. He appeared to \nhave a promising career ahead of him. However, due to political \nupheaval in Rome, Brumidi sought asylum in America, where he hoped to \nfind independence and opportunity in a new land.\n  On September 18, 1852, 59 years to the day when George Washington \nlaid the cornerstone of the Capitol building, Brumidi landed in New \nYork.\n\n\n  Because of his love of democracy, it would not take Brumidi long to \nfully embrace his newly adopted home. That November he filed paperwork \nto become an American citizen.\n  Many of us have parents or grandparents who immigrated here from \nother countries, looking to escape oppression or to come to the land of \nopportunity to give their children a better life. Many of them \nsucceeded in ways they never dreamed imaginable. Brumidi is one of \nthose success stories. Who could imagine that an immigrant would be \ntasked with decorating the most significant building in the United \nStates? I believe that it is a testament both to Brumidi's resolve and \nour great Nation's willingness to embrace those who want to share in \nthe American Dream.\n  Hundreds of thousands of people walk through these halls every year, \nbut they do not expect to see masterpieces that parallel those in \nfamous European museums and cathedrals. When they walk through the \nRotunda, they do no expect to look to the ceiling and see the \nmagnificent Apotheosis of George Washington and the great symbolism it \nportrays. But when they do, they look up and see Freedom, an armed \nwoman trampling terrified despots. Brumidi perfectly intertwined \nAmerican themes with his classical Greco-Roman artwork.\n  Brumidi was not a soldier. He never lead an army against a tyrannical \nrule; but just as Francis Scott Key strikes a cord in our hearts when \nwe hear the ``Star-Spangled Banner,'' Brumidi's legacy and \ncontributions to democracy will live forever. I can think of no better \nplace to commemorate the bicentennial of Brumidi's birth than in the \nRotunda, under his most famous painting.\n  Mr. Speaker, Brumidi once said, ``My one ambition and my daily prayer \nis that I may live long enough to make beautiful the Capitol of the one \ncountry on Earth in which there is liberty.''\n  There is no doubt in my mind, Mr. Speaker, that Constantino Brumidi \ndid just that.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. BILIRAKIS", "itemno": 6}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M000714", "text": "  Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California \nfor yielding me this time.\n  Mr. Speaker, Brumidi is alleged to have said, ``My one ambition and \nmy daily prayer is that I may live long enough to make beautiful the \nCapitol of the one country on Earth in which there is liberty.'' And to \nall of those who do come through this Capitol every day and see the \nbeautiful artwork, this is what we will be honoring and recognizing \nnext week.\n  This Capitol and the beautiful artwork and sculpture that is in it \nwas done by immigrants. Most of them did not make much money and most \nof them died poor. But they had a deep love for America, America. And \nConstantino Brumidi was no exception. He was exceptional.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Chairman Ney) and the \nCommittee on House Administration for bringing the resolution to the \nHouse floor. I also want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica) \nfor managing the resolution. The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica) has \nbeen the foremost leader in the Congress in promoting Brumidi's \nprolific life and his extraordinary legacy.\n  It reminds me a bit of a sculptor, a famous Italian-American \nsculptor, Gaetano Federici, who came from Italy, and his sculpture \nexists all through the metropolitan area in New Jersey and New York. \nSimilar backgrounds, came here not to accumulate a tremendous amount of \nwealth but to reflect their love of America, and they showed it and \ncommunicated it in their art. So it is a personal honor for me to lead \nthe House of Representatives in remembering Brumidi with the gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Mica).\n  The last time he was recognized in Congress was in 1980 at the 100th \nanniversary of his death. The late Congressman Peter Rodino, whom we \neulogized just a few weeks ago at his passing, a great American, \nconstituent, my friend, an inspiration, hosted the service. I know that \nCongressman Rodino is looking down on this ceremony today and will be \nhere next week. Perhaps he is with George Washington in what Brumidi \nproperly named in his most famous work, the Apotheosis of Washington. \nTwenty-five years later, I am humbled by the opportunity to continue a \nlegacy that Congressman Rodino pursued with passion.\n  Yesterday, I enjoyed a discussion with a roomful of Italian-American \nhigh school students from all across the Nation. Mr. Speaker, they \ntraveled to Washington on a trip to explore the roles that people of \ntheir ethnic background play in the Federal Government. We discussed \nour grand Italian-American heritage. We discussed ways to advance its \nimage. And when I fielded questions, one student asked, What is being \ndone now to elevate the positive image of our ethnic community? I was \nhappy to respond to this timely question. I told the students that \ntoday Congress would act to authorize a ceremony to honor Constantino \nBrumidi, the artist of the Capitol, an American\n\n\nimmigrant of both Italian and Greek descent.\n  I explained that we live in a Nation of immigrants, that Brumidi is \none of the greatest that we ever welcomed. He left Rome under \nunfortunate circumstances, having been imprisoned in the great fight in \nItaly for independence with both the Vatican and the state. Rome's loss \nwas America's gain. When the French occupied Rome in 1849, Brumidi was \naccused by the Church of being a revolutionary. The work he had been \ndoing in the Vatican came to an end. He set out for America where he \nhoped our free way of life would allow his talent to flourish. He \narrived in New York City. Think of that day in 1852. He was a proud \ncitizen 5 years later. Hear me, 5 years later. In fact, he was known to \nsign some of his work ``C. Brumidi Artist Citizen of the United \nStates.'' How fitting.\n  After traveling the country for work, in 1855 Brumidi's unique style \nfound its way to the empty walls of the United States Capitol. He was \ncommissioned by the Congress. Brumidi soon provided a unique ability to \napply a classical style to create American themes. Though paid \nhandsomely at the start of his career, Brumidi was not inspired by \nfinancial gain. After 2 years of work, he never got a raise. But his \nwork continued.\n  It continued in the Frieze of American History, in the Brumidi \nCorridor, in the Senate Appropriations Committee, in the reception room \nand in the President's Room, just to name a few. And on February 19, \n1880, exactly 25 years to the day after Brumidi began work at the \nCapitol, he died of a kidney failure. He died in poverty. And following \nhis death, Brumidi's name and work slipped into obscurity. Much of his \nartwork was painted over, in fact. He was looked at as irrelevant. It \nwas immaterial. It was not until 1952 that his grave site was \nrecognized by the Congress, the Congress that he dedicated his life to \nphysically enhance. It was not until 10 years ago that his work has \ntruly begun to be restored.\n  Brumidi was driven by enormous talent. He was driven by enormous \npatriotism. His passion allowed him to adorn the Capitol of his adopted \ncountry with the grand symbolism of a democratic Greco-Roman legacy.\n  The event that this resolution will authorize takes a step to ensure \nthat Americans will never forget one of our greatest historical \nfigures. It will work to ensure that every American, Italian, Greek, or \nwhatever, will recognize the name of Constantino Brumidi, one of the \ngreatest immigrants to ever grace America.\n  This is the 200th anniversary of his birth. This is the 150th \nanniversary of the beginning of his artistic career. And this is the \n125th anniversary of his death. It is only fitting that Congress honor \nConstantino Brumidi in this showplace, in the Capitol Rotunda, on the \nbicentennial of his birth.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. PASCRELL", "itemno": 8}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M000689", "text": "  Mr. MICA.

And everyone who comes to the Capitol today \nand during these weeks has no choice but to look at the work of \nConstantino Brumidi, to be affected and influenced by it.\n  Constantino Brumidi epitomizes the greatest democratic values that \nour country offers to the world: a sense of strength, a sense of pride, \na sense of hope, the sense that one can come here with nothing and \ncreate an enduring and permanent legacy of their values.\n  Constantino Brumidi captures not just the history that we view in his \nworks in the Capitol, but he also sends us a critical message about our \nfuture, our collective future. What he tells us in his work is that \nthis is a special place in the world, that one can come to America and \nwork hard, they can reach the literal zenith of their profession, and \nin that workforce all the rest of us can look up at what they have \ndone. That is something that should not be taken for granted.\n  I would suggest that only in America could Constantino Brumidi's \nworks be as cherished as they are. Only in America could his work force \nall the rest of us to look up at what he has done, and only in America \ncould people from all faiths and backgrounds be so influenced and \ninspired by what he has done. That is the true lesson of Constantino \nBrumidi. He does not capture the past. He tells us that the best is yet \nto come.\n  So I support this resolution.
