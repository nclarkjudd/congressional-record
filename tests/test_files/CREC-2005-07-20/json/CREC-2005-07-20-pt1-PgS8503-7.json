{"content": [{"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "F000439", "text": "  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today we will begin the Senate's session \nwith a 60-minute period for morning business. Following morning \nbusiness, we will return to the pending business of the Foreign \nOperations appropriations bill. We made substantial progress over the \ncourse of yesterday and last night, and although we were unable to \nfinish the bill, the chairman was able to reach a consent limiting the \nnumber of amendments we will handle today. Many of those amendments may \nbe worked out or perhaps not even offered. Therefore, we expect we can \nfinish the Foreign Operations appropriations bill at an early hour \ntoday. We will have rollcall votes throughout the day until final \npassage of that measure.\n  As a reminder to my colleagues, we filed a cloture motion on the Dorr \nnomination. That nomination is to be Under Secretary of Agriculture for \nRural Development. That cloture vote will occur on Thursday morning.\n  There are a number of other important issues we have mentioned over \nthe course of the last couple days, including last night, that we will \ncontinue to work toward agreements on. I will keep all of our \ncolleagues apprised as the schedule changes.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. FRIST", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "S8503", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "SCHEDULE", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgS8503-7", "title": "SCHEDULE"}
