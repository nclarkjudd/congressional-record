Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the \nhistoric state visit of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India. This \nvisit comes at a time of ever-warming relations between the United \nStates and India as these two great nations build partnerships in \ncommerce, security, science, health, and technology. At a time of great \nglobal unease and change, our proud country has found a fast friend in \nIndia.\n  In this chamber tomorrow, the Prime Minister will deliver a momentous \naddress to our Joint Session of Congress. His presence in this house \nwill send an unequivocal message to the government and the people of \nIndia. That message is that the United States stands in full support of \nthe Indian commitment to democracy, peace, and prosperity. This address \nwill show Indian and American citizens the significance of the enduring \nrelationship between our two great nations.\n  The United States and India have been partners in the birth of \nfreedom, in 1776 and 1947, from which we grew to be the world's oldest \nand largest democracies. Let us now be partners in the war against \nterror as we fight for a more secure existence. Let us be partners in \ntrade and economic growth that benefits all citizens. Let us be \npartners in scientific and technological advances that promote the \ncollective well-being. Let us be partners in expanding access to first-\nclass health care and quality education. Let us be partners in our \nstrong values, our commitment to our families, and our belief in \nhumanity.\n  Let the occasion of Prime Minister Singh's address also highlight the \nadvances and contributions of Indian-Americans. The pioneers of this \ncommunity first settled in California in the mid-1800s and worked as \nfarmers. This tiny minority was not granted the right to American \ncitizenship until 1947 and faced severe visa restrictions until 1965. \nFrom such humble beginnings, Indian-Americans have grown dramatically \nto a national population of 1.9 million. They are now the fastest \ngrowing Asian-American group in our great Nation. My district in Ohio \nis home to 2,480 Indian-Americans, who make vital contributions to our \neconomy, culture, and society.\n  Mr. Speaker, from my first visit to India in 1977 to having an \nIndian-American intern in my office every year since 1994, I have grown \nto appreciate and value the gifts of this nation to the world. I am \nthankful and proud to host Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the United \nStates. I call on my colleagues to work tirelessly to strengthen our \ngrowing relationship and forge new ties with the great nation of India.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BROWN of Ohio", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1543", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "COMMENDING THE CONTINUING IMPROVEMENT IN RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE REPUBLIC OF INDIA", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgE1543", "title": "COMMENDING THE CONTINUING IMPROVEMENT IN RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED  STATES AND THE REPUBLIC OF INDIA"}
