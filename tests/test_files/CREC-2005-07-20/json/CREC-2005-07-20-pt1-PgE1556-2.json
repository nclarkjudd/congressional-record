Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sadness to \nnote the recent passing of a dear friend and great American, Ben Ball \nof Morehead City, North Carolina.\n  Born on October 14, 1956, Ben died too soon at the age of 48. Yet in \nthose 48 years, he led a remarkable life.\n  After attending Wake Forest University, Ben went on to graduate from \nEast Carolina University and then began a successful 25-year career in \nthe real estate business. He was a member of the Carteret County \nAssociation of Realtors where he was named Realtor of the Year in 1981, \n1992, and in 2002. The North Carolina Association of Realtors named him \nState Realtor of the Year in 2003, and he served as President of the \nNorth Carolina Association in 1992. From 1991 through this year he \nserved as a State Director of the North Carolina Association of \nRealtors, and was active in the governmental and political process both \nin Raleigh and in Washington, DC.\n  In addition to his professional activities, Ben was a pillar of his \ncommunity. He was a lifetime member of First United Methodist Church in \nMorehead City, NC. He was a past President of the Rotary Club of \nMorehead City, and in 1997 was named Rotarian of the Year. \nAdditionally, he had served for 5 years as Sponsorship Chairman of the \nCrystal Coast Habitat for Humanity Golf Tournament, served as Past \nPresident of the Carteret County Division of the American Heart \nAssociation, Past President of the Morehead City Planning Board, and as \nPast Chairman of the Carteret County Republican Party. Further, he was \na volunteer at West Carteret High School, and assisted ``Toys for \nTots'' for the past 5 years to help secure over 500 bicycles for local \nneedy children.\n  Mr. Speaker, I first met Ben many years ago, and knew him as a friend \never since. While Ben was prominent in the community, most \nimportantly--like everyone else who first became acquainted with \nhim through politics, or business, or through community activities--I \ncame to know him not as a political friend, but just as a friend. \nPeriod.\n\n  He was unfailing supportive, uplifting, and caring toward the many \npeople in his life. His being here on this earth made a difference in \nways that we all know, and--I am positive--in countless ways that we \nwill never know.\n  In times such as this, there are no words that can fill the void in \nthe hearts of his friends and loved ones. While he is now in the loving \narms of God, we who are still here miss him.\n  Ben is survived by his wife, Debbie Carpenter Ball, by his sister \nAnne Roberts Ball, and by his daughters Debra Kreth Ball and Laura Ryan \nBall. They are all in my thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. JONES of North Carolina", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1556-E1557", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO BEN BALL OF MOREHEAD CITY, NORTH CAROLINA", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgE1556-2", "title": "TRIBUTE TO BEN BALL OF MOREHEAD CITY, NORTH CAROLINA"}
