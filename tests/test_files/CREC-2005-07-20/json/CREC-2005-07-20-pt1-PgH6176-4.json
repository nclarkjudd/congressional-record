Mr. Speaker, as a proud member of one of the oldest black \nsororities in the United States, I rise today to honor and recognize \nZeta Phi Beta Sorority, Incorporated, as it celebrates its 85th \nanniversary. Zeta was founded on January 16, 1920, by five students at \nHoward University, right here in our Nation's capital. A community-\nconscious action-oriented organization, Zeta Phi Beta has committed \nitself to uphold its founding principles of scholarship, service, \nsisterly love, and finer womanhood in over 700 communities around the \nworld.\n  Zeta Phi Beta Sorority was founded on the belief that the social \nnature of sorority life should not overshadow the real mission of \nprogressive organizations to address societal mores, ills, prejudice, \npoverty, and health concerns of the day.\n  Currently, under the direction of international president Barbara \nMoore, Zeta Phi Beta implements their national service program, Z-HOPE, \nwhich stands for Zetas Helping Other People Excel. Z-HOPE is a \ncommunity outreach initiative in direct response to the Healthy People \n2000 objectives established by the United States Department of Health \nand Human Services. Since the start of this initiative, Zeta women and \ntheir auxiliaries have touched the lives of thousands of men and women \nand children in more than 500 communities around the country.\n  Through their National Education Foundation, Zeta works with the \nDepartment of Energy to educate minority communities about the Human \nGenome Project. The foundation holds conferences across the Nation in \nboth rural and urban areas.\n  Zeta Phi Beta also has a long-standing partnership with the March of \nDimes to educate low-income mothers about prenatal care. Stork's Nest \nprovides incentives to help pregnant women make and keep prenatal care \nappointments and teaches expectant parents about healthy prenatal and \ninfant care practices. Over the past 2 years, more than 500,000 people \nparticipated in a program to raise the awareness of prematurity by \ntaking the message to the African American and Latino churches.\n  In 2003, Zeta founded the Zeta Congressional Institute in efforts to \nincrease the number of minority women who pursue careers as advocates \nand legislators. Zeta will encourage more minority women to pursue \ninternships in congressional offices and executive agencies to gain \nfirsthand knowledge of the political process.\n  For 85 years, the Zeta Phi Beta Sorority has worked to address the \nproblems that confront our communities. I am proud to celebrate this \nmomentous occasion with the ladies of Zeta Phi Beta, and I welcome them \nto Washington as they return here to celebrate the anniversary and the \nplace of their founding.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Ms. CARSON", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6176", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "ZETA PHI BETA SORORITY'S 85TH ANNIVERSARY", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6176-4", "title": "ZETA PHI BETA SORORITY'S 85TH ANNIVERSARY"}
