Mr. Speaker, I rise to share an important and exciting \nprogram with my colleagues today. The Charles B. Rangel International \nAffairs Program was initiated from my desire that the State \nDepartment's Diplomatic Corps abroad would reflect the rich diversity \nrepresented by its people at home. The program presents young adults \nfrom diverse backgrounds the opportunity to learn, participate, and \nbecome a part of the United States' diplomatic relations.\n  The Honorable Gentleman from New York, Mr. Serrano, has provided \nimmeasurable support and commitment to this program and was of \nextraordinary service in commencing the program in 2001. I want to \nagain thank him for his valuable contributions to the program.\n  Earlier this week, I met with the ten extremely talented Rangel \nFellows who are enrolled in various graduate programs across the \ncountry with a focus on international relations and related academic \nprograms. It was tremendously rewarding to speak to and hear from these \nextraordinarily intelligent, enthusiastic, well-prepared, and committed \nyoung people; many of whom have already completed Overseas State \nDepartment Summer Internships through the program. These ten fellows \nare currently serving in the congressional offices of Representatives \nEni F.H. Faleomavaega (Fellows Melanie Bonner and Natalie Waugh), \nHarold E. Ford, Jr. (Fellow Rachel Hawkins), Barbara Lee (Fellow Fonta \nGilliam), Robert Menendez (Fellow Breanna Green), Gregory Meeks (Fellow \nZainab Zaid), Donald M. Payne (Fellow Jared Yancey), Jose E. Serrano \n(Fellow David Lewis), as well as my own office (Fellow Andrea Corey). \nFellow Candace Bates is completing an internship at the State \nDepartment's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs.\n  I want to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues and friends \nfor the invaluable experiences that they are providing and for \npersonally hosting a Rangel Fellow in their offices. The experiences to \nbe obtained in here in the House of Representatives will provide \ninsight that is a special and unique part of this program. This Capitol \nHill exposure and experience will be particularly useful as they enter \nthe State Department as junior Foreign Service Officers. Thank you for \nthe wonderful opportunities that you are providing this summer.\n\n  It is with gratitude that I also thank Representatives Berkley, \nChristensen, Conyers, Hyde, Kilpatrick, Menendez, Millender-McDonald, \nand Serrano for hosting fellows last year, the inaugural session of the \n2004 Rangel Fellows Congressional Program.\n  I am extremely proud that there are currently 22 Rangel Fellows \nenrolled in graduate schools across the country, with a current intake \nof ten graduate students per year. Nine of these students are serving \nin internships in U.S embassies in locations around the world, \nincluding Pretoria, Luanda, Nairobi, Maseru, Dakar, Vientiane, \nTegucigalpa, and Singapore. The diverse body of fellows includes Afro-\nAmericans, Cambodian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans, \nand Caucasian Americans and draws on a variety of backgrounds and \nexperiences.\n  Earlier this month, I was extremely grateful and proud to be greeted \nin Singapore by two Rangel Fellows, Chelsa Wheeler who was assigned to \nthe U.S. Embassy in Singapore and Christen Rhodes, who was assigned to \nVientiane. I met and chatted with these two amazing young women while I \nwas awaiting the report from the Olympics Site Selection Committee.\n  This program is a successful collaboration between the Congress, the \nState Department, and Howard University, which administers the program \nwith a cross-section of colleges and universities across the country. \nFormer Secretary of State Colin L. Powell introduced the program on May \n17, 2002 at a State Department ceremony and most recently, Secretary of \nState Condoleezza Rice expressed her profound support for continuing \nand expanding this initiative.\n  Although the program has several components, the two key components \nare the Fellows Program and the Summer Enrichment Program, SEP, a six-\nweek program designed to expose students to foreign affairs careers and \nstimulate stronger interest in the Foreign Service. Approximately \nthirty students participate in the SEP each year and earn nine semester \nhours upon successful completion. Since 2003, over 53 undergraduate \nstudents have participated in the SEP, with a number being motivated to \napply for Graduate Rangel Fellowships.\n  In the last 2 years, the components of the Rangel Program were \nreviewed and evaluated by the State Department and were found to \nsatisfy the stringent requirements for inclusion in the Department's \nprestigious Diplomacy Fellows Program. This milestone achievement has \nincluded the program in the distinguished ranks of such programs as the \nPresidential Management Interns, the American Association for the \nAdvancement of Science, and the Boren, Fascell, and Pickering Fellows \nPrograms. As a result, fellows who successfully complete the Rangel \nProgram and the State Department requirements will automatically \nreceive employment offers and appointments to the Foreign Service.\n  I am extremely proud of this program and its contributions to this \ncountry. Not only does it expose youth from various backgrounds and \nexperiences to the importance and significance of international \nrelations, it creates the opportunity to diversify our diplomatic corps \nand to assist in their employment and service to our country. We cannot \nafford to overlook or underutilize any of our valuable human resources \nhere. In America, diversity is our strength. We have so much to offer \nin sharing our experience and creating a harmonious society. With our \nNation's growing international involvement, there could be no better \ntime than now to attract the very best, the brightest, and the most \ndiverse talent available to represent the American people and champion \nour interests in every corner of the globe.\n  I submit the following article from today's Roll Call on the program \nand the Fellows' recent visit to my office. It was indeed an honor to \nmeet this talented group of America's future.\n\n\n  fellowship fosters diversity: rangel fellowship focuses on foreign \n                                service\n\n       Since 2003, Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-N.Y.) has been the \n     impetus behind a program at Howard University designed to \n     increase diversity in the State Department Foreign Service.\n       ``Ever since I've been in Congress,'' Rangel explained in \n     an interview, ``the absence of minorities in our embassies \n     and official offices has been astounding.'' Every time he \n     brought it up to a Secretary of State, however, he was told \n     that the problem was lack of interest in the minority \n     community.\n       ``They said the kids couldn't pass the test, and that kids \n     weren't interested,'' Rangel said. ``Everyone of them would \n     have a meeting with me talking about change, and then leave \n     office.''\n       That cycle changed with Madeleine Albright, President Bill \n     Clinton's (D) final Secretary of State.\n       ``She agreed that she would entertain a proposal, so I went \n     to my first administrative assistant, Patrick Swygert, who \n     had become president of Howard University.'' Along with \n     former Secretary of State Colin Powell, a member of Howard's \n     Board of Trustees,\n       Swygert drafted a proposal to create the Rangel Fellowship.\n       The fellowship, which pays students $28,000 a year to cover \n     tuition and room and board, requires participants get a two-\n     year master's\n\n\n     degree in a field of interest to the foreign service. \n     International affairs is the most obvious choice, but a whole \n     range of subjects, including foreign languages and \n     political science, are options.\n       In addition to their studies, Rangel fellows are provided \n     with two internships. One of those internships takes place on \n     Capitol Hill in Congressional offices. Rangel is very proud \n     of the bipartisan support he has received; participants in \n     the program include Reps. Jose Serrano (D-N.Y.) and Henry \n     Hyde (R-Ill.).\n       ``It's a great program,'' Serrano spokesman Ben Allen said. \n     ``It gives students a chance to see the Congressional side of \n     government up close. The key thing is that it gives them \n     experiences that will help them in the foreign service. The \n     lessons that they learn here are invaluable.''\n       The most recent class of Charles B. Rangel International \n     Affairs Program fellows graduated 20 participants at the end \n     of May.\n       The second internship takes place in a U.S. embassy. When \n     Rangel traveled to Singapore to make New York's case for \n     hosting the 2012 Olympics, he was pleasantly surprised to \n     find himself greeted by two Rangel fellows, Chelsia Wheeler \n     and Christen Rhodes.\n       The fellows also participate in a summer enrichment \n     program, a six-week program ``designed to stimulate stronger \n     student interest in international affairs and to generate a \n     deeper understanding and appreciation for career \n     opportunities in international affairs.'' That program \n     recently wrapped up and is not just for Rangel fellows; any \n     college student who has completed his or her sophomore year \n     can apply.\n       Upon graduation, students are contractually committed to at \n     least three years of service as a Foreign Service Officer. \n     After a training period in Washington, officers are sent out \n     around the globe to perform consular work.\n       The program is directed by Kevin McGuire, formerly the \n     ambassador to Namibia. He said that initially, the fellowship \n     ``was designed to bring people to Washington for the summer \n     enrichment program. This grew into the idea of a fellowship \n     program. While we continue the SEP, the central focus right \n     now is the fellowship program.''\n       The current Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, has also \n     expressed her support for the program, even stating that she \n     thinks it should be expanded, Rangel said. ``About a month \n     ago I met with Condoleezza Rice, and she recommended I get \n     this program going in every historically black college.'' \n     Rangel has been thrilled by the level of participation thus \n     far. ``It's been a smashing success. Their enthusiasm \n     rejuvenates me. Retired black ambassadors who had to break \n     new ground to get in the door, they are mentors for students \n     today. A lot of mentoring goes on, and there's a lot of \n     cooperation from the U.S. State Department.''\n       The Congressman believes that in a time of increased \n     involvement with the rest of the world, the United States \n     must make a special effort to increase the number of people \n     in the diplomatic corps. ``We are recruiting people to keep \n     the peace and keep the diplomacy,'' Rangel said. ``We need to \n     reach out to people to show them how exciting the opportunity \n     can be. We need to show them that there are different people \n     all over the world.''\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. RANGEL", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1548-E1549", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "RANGEL FELLOWS", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgE1548-2", "title": "RANGEL FELLOWS"}
