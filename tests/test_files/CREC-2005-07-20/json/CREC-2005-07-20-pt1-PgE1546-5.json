JOE KNOLLENBERG\n\n                              of michigan\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                        Wednesday, July 20, 2005\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "K000288", "text": "  Mr. KNOLLENBERG. Mr. Speaker, United States foreign policy toward the \nSouth Caucasus nations is one of fostering regional stability and \nenhanced cooperation. I rise today to bring attention to the great \ninjustice in relations in this region.\n  I speak today to stress my opposition and to move forward with \nlegislation contesting the proposed railroad connecting Tbilisi, \nGeorgia and Kars, Turkey. The proposed railroad would systematically \nbypass Armenia, and push them further into isolation.\n  As we all know, Turkey and Armenia have their differences. Although \nit is counterproductive to list those differences, instead I want to \nhighlight the fact that it goes against United States policy to be in a \nposition that further advances the turmoil in this region, The proposed \nlegislation would bar U.S. support and funding for a rail link \nconnecting Georgia and Turkey, but which directly averts Armenia.\n  Eight years ago, the former Turkish president and the former Georgian \npresident meant to discuss the railroad that would ``open a third \nfrontier crossing between the two countries,'' providing further \ncommerce and economic opportunity for the South Caucasus region. Both \ncountries would benefit immensely from this railroad.\n  While I will always support commerce-based proposals that spawn \neconomic development around the world, this proposal initiates commerce \nat the cost of another country's economic development. This is \nunacceptable.\n  This railroad would cost between $400-$800 million to construct, \nwhile a perfectly workable and capable rail link already exists. It is \nevident to all that this new rail system is being proposed for the \nspecific reason of diverting commerce around Armenia.\n  The construction of the proposed railroad would be equivalent to the \npeople of Ohio building a new bridge to Canada just to avoid traveling \nthrough Michigan. The United States government would never condone this \naction, and we should not be in the practice of condoning the actions \nset forth by the Turkish government.\n\n\n  The existing rail would be available for use within weeks of an \nagreement between Armenia, Turkey, and Georgia. Furthermore, the \nArmenian people are willing to forego using the rail until normal \nrelations with Turkey are established. Mr. Speaker, although normal \nrelations may still take some time, there is no reason to further shut \nArmenia out of the equation.\n\n  Moreover, the building of this railroad also highlights the ongoing \nstruggle between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Known by all, Azerbaijan's \nmain goal is to strangle Armenia into submission of Nagorno-Karabakh. \nThis railroad does just that.\n  The United States and other countries around the world, including \nTurkey, need to allow these two countries to agree upon a solution \nregarding Nagorno-Karabakh. It is necessary that third parties remain \nneutral. The proposed railroad not only stunts the diplomatic progress \nbetween Armenia, Turkey and Azerbaijan, it unnecessarily blocks \nArmenia's economic and political progress.\n  I encourage my colleagues to look at the facts of this situation. The \nexisting rail link would be available essentially as soon as possible \nand it would take a minimal amount of funding in order to get it usable \nagain. Whereas, a new rail link would take months if not years to \nbuild, and would cost an estimated $400-$800 million. There should be \nno question as to which plan the United States supports.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KNOLLENBERG", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1546-E1547", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "SOUTH CAUCASUS OPEN RAIL LINK ACT", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgE1546-5", "title": "SOUTH CAUCASUS OPEN RAIL LINK ACT"}
