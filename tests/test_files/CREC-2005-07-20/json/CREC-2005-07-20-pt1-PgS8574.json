The \n     United States Trade Representative should consult with our \n     trading partners regarding any trade dispute with China.\n       (C) Actions to encourage United States diplomatic efforts \n     to identify and pursue initiatives to revitalize United \n     States engagement with China's Asian neighbors. The \n     initiatives should have a regional focus and complement \n     bilateral efforts. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation \n     forum (APEC) offers a ready mechanism for pursuit of such \n     initiatives.\n       (D) Actions by the administration to hold China accountable \n     for proliferation of prohibited technologies and to secure \n     China's agreement to renew efforts to curtail North Korea's \n     commercial export of ballistic missiles.\n       (E) Actions to encourage the creation of a new United \n     Nations framework for monitoring the proliferation of WMD and \n     their delivery systems in conformance with member nations' \n     obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the \n     Biological Weapons Convention, and the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention. The new monitoring body should be delegated \n     authority to apply sanctions to countries violating these \n     treaties in a timely manner, or, alternatively, should be \n     required to report all violations in a timely manner to the \n     Security Council for discussion and sanctions.\n       (F) Actions by the administration to conduct a fresh \n     assessment of the ``One China'' policy, given the changing \n     realities in China and Taiwan. This should include a review \n     of--\n       (i) the policy's successes, failures, and continued \n     viability;\n       (ii) whether changes may be needed in the way the United \n     States Government coordinates its defense assistance to \n     Taiwan, including the need for an enhanced operating \n     relationship between United States and Taiwan defense \n     officials and the establishment of a United States-Taiwan \n     hotline for dealing with crisis situations;\n\n\n       (iii) how United States policy can better support Taiwan's \n     breaking out of the international economic isolation that \n     China seeks to impose on it and whether this issue should be \n     higher on the agenda in United States-China relations; and\n       (iv) economic and trade policy measures that could help \n     ameliorate Taiwan's marginalization in the Asian regional \n     economy, including policy measures such as enhanced United \n     States-Taiwan bilateral trade arrangements that would include \n     protections for labor rights, the environment, and other \n     important United States interests.\n       (G) Actions by the Secretaries of State and Energy to \n     consult with the International Energy Agency with the \n     objective of upgrading the current loose experience-sharing \n     arrangement, whereby China engages in some limited exchanges \n     with the organization, to a more structured arrangement \n     whereby China would be obligated to develop a meaningful \n     strategic oil reserve, and coordinate release of stocks in \n     supply-disruption crises or speculator-driven price spikes.\n       (H) Actions by the administration to develop and publish a \n     coordinated, comprehensive national policy and strategy \n     designed to meet China's challenge to maintaining United \n     States scientific and technological leadership and \n     competitiveness in the same way the administration is \n     presently required to develop and publish a national security \n     strategy.\n       (I) Actions to revise the law governing the Committee on \n     Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), including \n     expanding the definition of national security to include the \n     potential impact on national economic security as a criterion \n     to be reviewed, and transferring the chairmanship of CFIUS \n     from the Secretary of the Treasury to a more appropriate \n     executive branch agency.\n       (J) Actions by the President and the Secretaries of State \n     and Defense to press strongly their European Union \n     counterparts to maintain the EU arms embargo on China.\n       (K) Actions by the administration to restrict foreign \n     defense contractors, who sell sensitive military use \n     technology or weapons systems to China, from participating in \n     United States defense-related cooperative research, \n     development, and production programs. Actions by the \n     administration may be targeted to cover only those technology \n     areas involved in the transfer of military use technology or \n     weapons systems to China. The administration should provide a \n     comprehensive annual report to the appropriate committees of \n     Congress on the nature and scope of foreign military sales to \n     China, particularly sales by Russia and Israel.\n       (L) Any additional actions outlined in the 2004 Report to \n     Congress of the United States-China Economic and Security \n     Review Commission that affect the economic or national \n     security of the United States.", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 23}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                 ______\n  SA 1313.
