Mr. Speaker, let me read the citation of Admiral \nStockdale's Medal of Honor, just so people understand. ``By his heroic \naction, in great peril to himself, he earned the everlasting gratitude \nof his fellow POWs and to his country.'' This was Admiral Stockdale. He \nwas our friend, and he died.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time that this Nation honor both Admiral Stockdale \nand his wife Sybil for the sacrifices that they gave to this country. \nEvery dog face pilot, enlisted and officer, knew about the courage, not \nonly of Admiral Stockdale, but the rest of our POWs. Sybil organized, \nnot just for the MIAs, but for the POWs together, the entire program \nthat supported the families of the MIAs and the POWs, and for that we \nhonor them.\n  We know what the family is going through, even from July 5, the \nsadness that they have. But they can go to sleep at night knowing that \nAdmiral Stockdale and Sybil, that this country owes a great, great deal \nto those individuals.\n  People in San Diego and around this country, it is time to remember \nAdmiral Stockdale and Sybil for not only their patriotism, but the \nsacrifices of men like Sam Johnson, like John McCain, like Jeremiah \nDenton and the other POWs and some of those that did not come back.\n  I yield to the gentleman.", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. CUNNINGHAM", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H000981", "text": "  Mr. HUNTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I was just looking at the price tag of some of our high \nperformance aircraft that we are going to be buying. You look at it and \nyou say, we do not want to pay that, and then you reflect on the \nprisoners of war and that incredible defensive barrier that our pilots \nhad to fly in, fly through to get into their targets in North Vietnam, \nand you say to yourself at that point I only want our pilots to have \nthe very best.\n  So while I guess I am like everybody else, I get a little sticker \nshock when I look at the price of an aircraft. Of course, we get the \nsame thing when we look at the price of a new car today in this \ncountry. I reflect when I see the incredible courage of those who strap \nthemselves into that cockpit and fly out to protect American freedom \nand to protect our country, that they need the very, very best.\n  I would just ask the gentleman, because I know that he is familiar \nwith the MiG aircraft, the latest high performance MiG aircraft, and I \nthink one of his jobs, because the gentleman from California (Mr. \nCunningham) knows aircraft, one of his jobs is to make sure that we \nkeep high performance capability in the skies. I would just ask him for \nhis reflections on what he thinks we need to do to maintain a strong \nAmerican air power.", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. HUNTER", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "C000994", "text": "  Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, I am a Navy guy, but the F-22 is the \nonly\n\n\nairplane in the inventory that is projected that will compete with the \nSU-30 and SU-37.\n  To give my colleagues a comparison, Admiral Stockdale was flying an \nA-4 Skyhawk. At the time it was not a bad airplane, but they did not \nhave the new PH or the P-408 engines, which is more powerful. And they \nloaded bombs on that little Skyhawk and it made it real cumbersome \nflying. I was lucky enough to fly Phantoms and some F-8s and other \nairplanes like the Thud and so on, but those little A-4 Skyhawks were \npretty vulnerable.\n  Admiral Stockdale was shot down in 1965 before they each had surface-\nto-air missiles in Vietnam, he was shot down by Triple A, and those \nairplanes were slow and cumbersome. That is why we do not want our men \nand women flying airplanes that are not the best or driving Humvees \nthat are not armored or other things, because if you look at the \nhistory of the past, like Admiral Stockdale and John McCain and \nJeremiah Denton and all the others, that they were shot down, and not \nbecause they had necessarily inferior equipment, but not the best \nequipment. That is what we want to make sure of today, that our men and \nwomen who are serving overseas, as the chairman of the authorization \ndefense committee, the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) has \ndedicated his life.

Mr. Speaker, I know that my son would like to remind the \ngentleman that it was a Marine pilot who rescued you when you went \ndown.\n  But there is another point to American air power, and I think \nAmerican air power in the future, and that is something that one of our \nreal giants, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde), brought up, along \nwith the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), was this provision \nthat we just passed, that just passed the House in his amendment to his \nbill, which gives the President leverage against Western countries, \nEuropean countries, our allies who would sell military technology to \nChina. Because there is a possibility that at some point in the future \nwe may be in a conflict with China, and I think it would be a terrible \nthing if we saw any type of technology that gives them the ability to \nacquire American aircraft on a radar screen or to launch weaponry or \nmunitions at that aircraft, or to have in their own aircraft, I would \nhate to see American stealth capability and technology.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. HUNTER", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "C000994", "text": "  Mr. CUNNINGHAM.
