CHET EDWARDS\n\n                                of texas\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                         Tuesday, July 12, 2005\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "E000063", "text": "  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I did not just like Jake Pickle; I loved \nJake Pickle. Congressman Pickle was one of the finest public servants \nto have ever served in this House, and he was a true Texas treasure. He \nwas a kind, decent, caring human being who spent his entire life making \nlife better for others. Whether it was helping a veteran receive health \ncare, bringing research dollars, and he brought many of them, to his \nbeloved University of Texas or saving the Social Security system in \n1983, Jake was always dedicated to helping others.\n  Jake Pickle's faith was shown time and time again as he lived the \ncommandment to love thy neighbor. Jake Pickle lived every day with \nanother biblical verse, ``This is the day the Lord hath made. Let us \nrejoice and be glad in it.'' Jake lived every day joyfully. He lit up a \nroom when he walked into it because of his joyful, positive approach to \nlife. His positive approach has enlightened the lives of all of us \nblessed to have known him.\n  Jake Pickle exemplified courage when he voted as a freshman \nCongressman from I Texas to pass the Civil Rights Act which brought to \nreality the promise of equal opportunity to millions of African-\nAmericans. He did it because it was the right thing to do, even though \nit could have ended his political career.\n  I want to tell one story about my friend Jake Pickle. In June of \n1994, he and I were part of a U.S. congressional delegation on the 50th \nanniversary of D-Day. After the ceremony on June 4 of 1994, our bus was \nabout to leave to go back to a hotel an hour to 2 hours away. I noticed \nJake getting off the bus by himself. I stopped, walked up to him and \nsaid, ``Jake, what are you doing? And he said, Why don't you come with \nme, Chet?''\n  So I followed Jake Pickle off that bus. We walked several hundred \nyards. We went to Point du Hoc, that monument to American GI courage on \nD-Day when Colonel Earl Rudder led Rudder's Army Rangers up that stiff \ncliff against murderous fire by the Germans above them. It turned out \nthat Jake Pickle and Earl Rudder roomed together after the death of \nJake's first wife when then General Rudder was serving as land \ncommissioner in Austin, Texas.\n  So that June day in 1994, Jake Pickle got off the bus, not knowing \nhow he would get back to his hotel in France, to go pay his respects to \nhis personal friend and fellow Texan and American, Earl Rudder, the \nhero along with America's Rangers at Point du Hoc. That was the \ncharacter of Jake Pickle. Our Nation will miss Jake Pickle, but the \nworld is a better place today because of his life of dedicated public \nservice.\n  Mr. Speaker, Winston Churchill once said that we make a living by \nwhat we get, we make a life by what we give. By that high standard, \nJake Pickle led a rich life, a life that enriched everyone of us \nblessed to have known him.\n  Goodbye, my friend, until we meet another day. Thank you for the \nmemories. Thank you for your friendship. Thank you for making America \nand the world a better place.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. EDWARDS", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1542", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "IN REMEMBRANCE OF J.J.
