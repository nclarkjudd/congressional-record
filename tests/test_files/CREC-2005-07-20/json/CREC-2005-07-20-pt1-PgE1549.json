Mr. Speaker, I rise again today, as I have for more \nthan 2 decades, to voice intense objection to the illegal occupation of \nCyprus by Turkish troops and to declare my grave concern for the future \nof the island. The Turkish incursion into Cyprus, 30-plus years ago, \nhas rendered a legacy of internal division, and should worry those in \nthis Chamber who cherish freedom and espouse the virtues of democracy.\n  In July 1974, Turkish troops invaded and captured the northern part \nof Cyprus, seizing more than a third of the island. The Turkish \nstrategy included ethnic cleansing. Not only did the Turks expel \n200,000 Greek-Cypriots from their homes, but Turkish troops were also \nresponsible for the systematic killing of 5,000 innocent civilians. In \nthe process, Turkey installed 40,000 military personnel on Cyprus. \nToday, these troops, in conjunction with United Nations (U.N.) \npeacekeeping forces, make the small, once peaceful island of Cyprus one \nof the most militarized areas in the world. Well over a quarter of a \ncentury later, approximately 1,500 Greek-Cypriots remain missing, \nincluding four Americans.\n  The Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot communities are separated by a \n113-mile barbed wire fence, called the Green Line. Until 2003, the \nTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), a government formally \nrecognized only by Turkey, prohibited Greek-Cypriots from freely \ncrossing the Green Line to visit the towns and communities of their \nfamilies. Controlling 37 percent of the island, Turkey's military \noccupation has had severe consequences, most notably the dislocation of \nthe Greek-Cypriot population and the resulting refugees.\n  More than thirty years later, despite efforts by G-8 countries and \nthe U.N. generally, the forced separation of these two communities \npersists. The U.N., with the explicit support of the United States, has \nsponsored several rounds of proximity talks between the Greek-Cypriots \nin the South and the Turkish-controlled north.\n  The U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan took a lead role in brokering a \nreunification proposal. On several occasions, my colleagues and I \nstrongly voiced our serious concerns with the Annan plan through \nletters, meetings, and floor statements. We warned that the plan, as \nwritten, was not viable and did not assuage the Greek-Cypriots' \nsecurity fears. Without a doubt, greater efforts should have been made \nto address these legitimate security concerns.\n  By ignoring these concerns, Greek-Cypriot voters were put in the \nadverse position of having to oppose the plan. On April 24, 2004, they \nmade clear that the suggested settlement failed because it did not \nprovide certain guarantees, nor did it ensure complete compliance by \nTurkey once the plan was implemented. Had their concerns been \naddressed, I have no doubt that the Annan plan would have received an \noverwhelming positive vote.\n  The Annan plan did not include a thorough removal of foreign troops \nfrom Cyprus. Although previous versions of the Annan plan called for \nthe complete withdrawal of Greek and Turkish forces once Turkey joined \nthe European Union, the final version of the Annan plan provided for an \nindefinite presence of Turkish troops in Cyprus. According to the plan, \nthe number of troops would gradually decrease to 650 over a period of \nfourteen years.\n  The plan also provided for the continuation of the Treaty of \nGuarantee, maintaining the guarantor powers (Turkey, Greece, and the \nUnited Kingdom) the right to unilaterally intervene in order to \npreserve the ``constitutional order'' of the United Cyprus Republic and \nits constituent states. The Annan plan failed to clarify that this \ntreaty would not authorize military intervention.\n  This is a critical point, because Turkey insist that it continues to \nhave the right to intervene militarily in Cyprus.\n  Additionally, the Annan plan did not provide for a property recovery \nsystem that would recognize the rights and interests of displaced \nGreek-Cypriots, nor did it include a satisfactory property compensation \nsystem. Specifically, the plan allowed for one-third restitution and \ntwo-thirds compensation for Greek-Cypriots who would lose the use of \ntheir northern properties. The Federal Government of Cyprus would be \nresponsible for disbursing the restitutive funds. Nine-tenths of the \nFederal State's resources, however, derive from Greek-Cypriots. \nTherefore, the plan essentially called for Greek-Cypriots to pay for \nthe loss of their property.\n  In addition, the plan required constituent states to pay the \ncompensation for property transfers. This meant that Greek-Cypriot \nrefugees would have to request compensation from the Greek-Cypriot \nConstituent State. Again, Greek-Cypriot taxpayers, who were the victims \nof the invasion, would be paying for their own losses.\n  The Annan plan failed to institute policies that could have \nengendered cohesion between the two communities. The plan failed to \nprovide a viable government free of built-in deadlocks and voting \nrestrictions, establishing instead a system based on permanent ethnic \ndivision and the denial of democratic rights to a segment of the \npopulation. The plan ignored the right of all Cypriots to buy property \nand to live wherever they choose without being limited by ethnic \nquotas. Furthermore, the plan set complicated and restrictive \nprovisions regarding the right of Greek-Cypriot refugees to return to \ntheir homes in the north. In fact, the plan mandated that no more than \n33.3 percent of the TRNC population could be Greek-Cypriot. This \nrestriction would have been permanent. In addition, under the plan, \nGreek-Cypriots permanently living in the TRNC and possessing its \ninternal citizenship status would not have the right to participate in \nelections for its 24 representatives in the federal Senate.\n  Since the vote on the referenda, Greek-Cypriots have been criticized \nfor allegedly rejecting peace and the ``only chance'' for \nreunification. Many people--including the Greek-Cypriots themselves--\nregret that the presented plan did not allow both communities to \nrespond positively. Criticism and anger, however, will only further \ndivide the island precisely when the Cypriot people need the support of \nthe international community to continue on the path toward lasting \npeace.\n\n  Greek-Cypriots should not be blamed for voting against a plan that \nthey believed did not\n\n\nmeet the interests of their country and their futures. It is one thing \nfor others to comment on the terms and conditions for settlement, but \nit is the Cypriots who must live with whatever plan is adopted.\n  The Government of Cyprus continues to emphasize that it remains \ncommitted to reunify Cyprus as a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation with \ndemocratic and human rights for all Cypriots. The Cypriot Government \nhas announced a series of measures aimed at assisting those Turkish \nCypriots residing under the control of the occupying Turkish army. The \npackage included a wide range of political, social, humanitarian, \neducational and economic measures that would enhance the Turkish-\nCypriots' ability to enjoy many of the benefits that the Republic of \nCyprus offers to its citizens--including benefits which result from its \nEuropean Union membership. Far beyond a merely symbolic gesture, the \npackage is a substantive program to integrate the Turkish-Cypriot \ncommunity into the larger Cypriot society.\n  The Republic of Cyprus and Greek-Cypriots have provided the Turkish-\nCypriot community more than $700 million dollars in aid. In the past \ntwo years, the government of Cyprus has paid more than $43 million \ndollars in social insurance pensions to Turkish-Cypriots, and Turkish-\nCypriots working outside the Green Line made $7 million dollars in \nwages last year. Since April 2003, more than 24,000 Turkish-Cypriots \nhave received free treatment in hospitals and medical centers inside \nthe Republic of Cyprus, the combined cost of which totals more than $9 \nmillion dollars.\n  Since the invasion more than three decades ago, Turkish occupied \nareas have received free electricity from the Cyprus Electricity \nAuthority at a cost of nearly $343 million dollars. Together, more than \n150,000 birth certificates, identity cards and passports have been \nprovided to Turkish-Cypriots by the Republic of Cyprus, so that \nTurkish-Cypriots could travel and acquire work more efficiently. The \nRepublic of Cyprus has begun a program where it pays the full tuition \nfees of Turkish-Cypriot pupils in secondary education private schools \nin the government controlled areas. The program to date has promised \nmore than 5.4 million in tuition fees, and the program added five times \nas many students this year than it did in its first year, 2003.\n\n  The occupying Turkish regime partially relaxed restrictions that \nlimited travel across the Green Line. Since then, there have been more \nthan five million incident-free border crossings by Turkish and Greek \nCypriots to visit areas and homes that were inaccessible to them for \nover 30 years. As a result, Greek-Cypriots have infused more than $57 \nmillion dollars into the impoverished, Turkish-occupied economy in the \nNorth. It isn't clear whether opening the border was just a tactic to \nease frustrations, or a sign that Turkey has had a fundamental change \nof heart. Nevertheless, it has produced rare displays of human kinship, \nexchanges of flowers and pastries, and emotional visits to homes \nabandoned in the mid-1970s.\n  Still, neither the Government's incomplete, albeit well-intentioned, \nbenefit package for Turkish-Cypriots, nor the limited lifting of \nrestrictions by Turkey's occupying regime, substitutes for a \ncomprehensive resolution to end Cyprus' divide. I urge the Bush \nAdministration, the United Nations the European Union, and this \nhonorable body to respect the democratic decision of the Cypriot \npeople, to remain engaged in efforts to resolve the Cyprus problem, and \nto work toward a fair and lasting reunification of Cyprus.\n  As Cyprus works toward reunification it is imperative that leaders \nand diplomats from the United States and other nations respect and \nobserve Cypriot law and international law in their dealings with \nCyprus. Recently, Members of Congress traveled directly into the \nnorthern airport of Cyprus in Tymbou. Direct flights into occupied \nCyprus are inconsistent with principles of international law and in \ntension with domestic law of the United States. In particular, it is \nindisputable that international law mandates that flights cannot enter \na country's airspace without the consent of the sovereign government. \nIndeed, the Convention on International Civil Aviation, signed in \nChicago on December 7, 1944, provides that ``the contracting States \nrecognize that every State has complete and exclusive sovereignty over \nthe airspace above its territory.'' The Republic of Cyprus' sovereignty \nover the entire territory of Cyprus has been recognized and reaffirmed \nby numerous U.N. Security Council Resolutions, as well as long-standing \nU.S. policy.\n\n  Section 620C of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, amended in 1979, \nseparately establishes that the United States' foreign policy towards \nCyprus is to support the withdrawal of all Turkish forces from Cyprus \nand the reunification of the island. Any government or congressional \ntrip will not only derail and discourage reunification efforts, but to \nthe contrary, will be exploited as an implicit recognition of the so-\ncalled ``Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus'' by the United States, \nthus further reinforcing the island's division.\n  It is my understanding that at no time has the Republic of Cyprus \nauthorized flights into the illegal airports situated in the occupied \narea of Cyprus. Moreover, flights into these airports are not \nnecessary; the Republic of Cyprus encourages visits to the occupied \narea in a manner that does not create insurmountable legal issues and \nreinforce the existing division of the island.\n  What is surprising and disappointing is that our own State Department \nencouraged these Members to fly directly to the airport in the TRNC \nunder the guise of easing the isolation of Turkish-Cypriots. The State \nDepartment has authorized U.S. government personnel to travel directly \nto northern Cyprus, but they require that they must use their tourist \npassports. I don't understand why they are not instructed to use their \nofficial passports since they are visiting the TRNC on official \nbusiness. I believe that if the legality of direct travel to TRNC were \nnot in dispute, requiring U.S. government personnel to use their \ntourist passports would be pointless.\n  The State Department maintains that this policy is consistent with \nU.S. and international law and that neither U.S. nor international law \nprohibits U.S. citizens from traveling directly to the TRNC. While the \nState Department is technically correct that nothing precludes U.S. \nleaders, diplomats, staff, or citizens from entering the airport in the \nnorth of Cyprus, such actions do contravene the Chicago Convention and \ncontradict established U.S. foreign policy.\n  I have sent letters to President George W. Bush and U.S. Secretary of \nState Condoleezza Rice expressing concern regarding the legality of \nU.S. citizens, U.S. government personnel, and Members of Congress \nflying directly from Turkey to the airport at Tymbou in the occupied \nnorthern part of Cyprus. The letters also requested legal clarification \non direct flights to TRNC by U.S. citizens, U.S. government personnel, \nand Members of Congress. These letters were signed by more than thirty \nof my colleagues.\n  I think they need to be reminded that the United States recognizes \nthe Republic of Cyprus as the only government of Cyprus, the Republic \nof Cyprus has not authorized flights into the northern airport, and the \nRepublic of Cyprus and the United States are signatories to the Chicago \nConvention. Therefore, when U.S. citizens travel to Cyprus through the \nnorthern airport they not only undermine an ally of the United States, \nbut they also flout U.S. foreign policy, which has been in place for \nten consecutive presidential terms. As the U.S. government never would \nallow members of the Cypriot House of Representatives to enter the \nUnited States through an airport that is not designated as a legal port \nof entry, it also should discourage U.S. citizens, U.S. government \npersonnel, and Members of Congress from doing the same in Cyprus.\n  Such actions do little more than undercut the reunification efforts. \nThe Turkish invasion of Cyprus is responsible for the destabilization \nof the Republic of Cyprus. Likewise, unauthorized travel into the \nnorthern airport, especially by American leaders, belittles the \nRepublic of Cyprus' authority and destroys its credibility. Cyprus' \nsovereignty deserves no less reverence from the United States than any \nother nation with which the U.S. deals and considers an ally.\n  American leaders should set an example for the rest of the world to \nfollow, and in all our dealings with Cyprus, our utmost concern ought \nto be reunification. We should look to correct the wrong that occurred \nmore than thirty years ago. We should work to bring about a just \nresolution to the situation. And, at the very least, we must act to \nhalt the continuing injustice which the world community allows to \ncontinue in Cyprus.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BILIRAKIS", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1549-E1550", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "THE 31ST ANNIVERSARY OF TURKISH ILLEGAL INVASION AND OCCUPATION OF CYPRUS", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgE1549", "title": "THE 31ST ANNIVERSARY OF TURKISH ILLEGAL INVASION AND OCCUPATION OF  CYPRUS"}
