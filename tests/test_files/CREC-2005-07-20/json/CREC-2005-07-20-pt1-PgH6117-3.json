I appreciate the offer by the chairman and ranking \nDemocrat to look at this, and I look forward to working with them and \nthe administration on this matter.\n  On that, Mr. Chairman, I would like to move to amendment No. 20.\n  Amendment 20 was made in order because it is dealing with an \nimportant matter. This amendment takes the necessary and commonsense \nsteps to enhance the security of American passports. It will help to \neliminate three major loopholes currently present in the passport \nacquisition process that have been exploited by criminals, especially \nover the last 5 years.\n  First, it requires the Secretary of State to submit a report that \ndescribes the weaknesses of identification documents, including birth \ncertificates, required for the issuance of passports. This report will \nlay out the minimum acceptable criteria for birth certificates issued \nby State and county governments in order for the certificates to be \naccepted by the State Department for the purpose of obtaining a \npassport.\n  Second, the amendment establishes a requirement that all passport \nagents undergo background investigations and comprehensive training \nprograms to improve fraudulent document detection and thereby reduce \nfraud. This will make it harder for insiders to sell passports to \ncriminals and terrorists and easier for government authorities to \ndiscover those who do. The Secretary of State would be authorized to \ndetermine requirements for both background checks and oversight of \nthese agents.\n  Finally, Mr. Chairman, and without a doubt most importantly, this \namendment expands the authority of the United States Government to \ninvestigate cases of illegal sales of passports and visas by U.S. \nGovernment personnel. It authorizes the Federal District Court of the \nDistrict of Columbia to issue warrants in such cases and authorizes \nspecial agents under the direction of the director of the Diplomatic \nSecurity Service to execute such warrants.\n\n\n  It will also require foreign service officers and other personnel \nserving abroad in diplomatic positions, including ambassadors, to waive \nany challenge to the Federal court jurisdiction over matters involving \nthe illegal sale of a passport or a visa or any other matter involving \nofficial corruption. The waiver would include any legal challenges to \nthe diplomatic security conducting investigations for the same.\n  This will resolve the current impasse that happens in a significant \nnumber of foreign countries when local magistrates and police officials \nare barred under respective local laws from allowing investigations by \nanybody into the homes of diplomats.\n  Mr. Chairman, the requirements laid out in this amendment will raise \nthe State Department's ability to detect and eliminate passport fraud. \nIt is critical for our Nation's security that we implement the measures \nI have laid out.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 13, "speaker": "Mr. ISSA", "itemno": 16}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000090", "text": "  Mr. LANTOS.

However, while we are \nprepared to accept this amendment, we hope we can make some \nmodifications as the legislative process moves forward.\n  Birth certificates are used by the State Department to help establish \nthe nationality of an applicant, not their identity, and the \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 establishes a \nFederal process to standardize U.S. birth certificates. The State \nDepartment is a full participant in that process, along with other \nFederal agencies, the States and the association that represents the \nregistrars of vital statistics. That process should be allowed to run \nits course, and it would be counterproductive for the Department of \nState to establish its own criteria for evaluating birth certificates.\n  In addition, it is unclear whether the training mandated by this \nprovision should be the responsibility of the State Department or the \nU.S. Postal Service, which employs most of the passport acceptance \nagents.\n  We hope to address these issues as this amendment moves forward.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.", "turn": 17, "speaker": "Mr. LANTOS", "itemno": 21}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "I000056", "text": "  Mr. ISSA.

Alex M.

At this \n     time, I understand that DOJ gave its tentative advice that \n     the so-called ``organization restrictions'' set forth in 23 \n     U.S.C.A. Sec. 7110()(2) and 22 U.S.C.A. Sec. 7631(f) could, \n     under the Constitution, be applied only to foreign \n     organizations acting overseas.\n       We have reviewed the matter further and are withdrawing \n     that tentative advice. The statures are clear on their face \n     that the organization restrictions were intended by Congress \n     to apply without the limitations identified in our earlier \n     advice. We have consulted with the Civil Division and, in \n     these circumstances, given that the provisions do not raise \n     separation of powers concerns and that there are reasonable \n     arguments to support their constitutionality, we believe that \n     HHS may implement these provisions. If the provisions are \n     challenged in court, the Department stands ready to defend \n     their constitutionality in accordance with its longstanding \n     practice of defending congressional enactments under such \n     circumstances.\n       Please do not hesitate to contract me if you have any \n     further questions. I apologize for any confusion or \n     inconvenience cause by our earlier tentative advice.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Daniel Levin,\n     Acting Assistant Attorney General.", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 43}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                Committe on Government Reform,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 2005.\n     Hon.

Andrew Natsios,\n     Administrator, United States Agency for International \n         Development, Ronald Reagan Building, Pennsylvania Avenue, \n         NW., Washington DC.\n       Dear Mr. Administrator: As Members of Congress who advocate \n     for the faith community, we write to express our deep concern \n     about the way in which the United States Agency for \n     International Development (USAID) is implementing the \n     Communities Responding to the HIV/AIDS Epedemic (CORE). As a \n     pillar of the Administration's faith-based outreach abroad, \n     CORE is an innovative initiative that partners USAID with \n     faith communities to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n       CORE's operating consortium is composed of five groups \n     including CARE USA, the World Council of Churches (WCC), the \n     International Center for Research on Women (ICRW), the \n     International HIV/AIDS Alliance (the Alliance), and the Johns \n     Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health/Center for \n     Communication Programs. We draw your attention to the first \n     four organizations because their policies often run contrary \n     to U.S. HIV/AIDS policy and frequently promote policies that \n     are offensive to people of faith.\n       Most disconcerting is the consortium's primary contractor, \n     CARE USA. The President of CARE, Peter Bell, has signed \n     public attacks on the Administration's pro-life policies, \n     calling them ``undemocratic'' and ``unethical''--and this is \n     only the beginning of CARE's opposition to American policy.\n       CARE's programs in India, most notably the Sonagachi \n     Project in Calcutta, have promoted a pro-prostitution agenda. \n     Samarjit Jana, CARE's Assistant Country Director in India, is \n     one of the world's leading crusaders for the legalization of \n     prostitution for the right of HIV-infected prostitutes to \n     have sex without a condom.\n       In Lesotho, CARE and USAID funding to campaign for a so-\n     called ``rights-based'' approach to prostitution--in other \n     words, for legalization of prostitution and its cultural \n     acceptance as a legitimate form of employment. Despite the \n     Administration's policy directive that all grantees of \n     taxpayer monies for work overseas must pledge to oppose the \n     legalization of prostitution, CARE continues to lead the CORE \n     consortium.\n       We are also concerned about the policies of ICRW, another \n     CORE member. In 2001, ICRW held a conference to plan strategy \n     for an agenda that included the legalization of prostitution. \n     Its pro-prostitution stance is radical that ICRW even \n     objected to the late Senator Paul Wellstone's Trafficking \n     Victims Protection Act (S. 1842, 106th Congress) because \n     ``the legislation does not currently distinguish between \n     forced prostitution and voluntary prostitution. Thus [ICRW \n     argued] it may be used as a punitive measure against \n     voluntary sex workers.\n       ICRW also holds other policy views that most faith-based \n     groups would find offensive. ICRW president Geeta Rao Gupta \n     is a strong critic of abstinence programs, arguing that ``the \n     traditional norm of virginity for unmarried girls that exists \n     in many societies, paradoxically, increase young women's risk \n     of infection because it restricts their ability to ask for \n     information about sex out of fear that they will be thought \n     to be sexually active.'' Gupta also objects to the \n     ``stigamatizing [of] sex workers'' because it ``increase[es] \n     their vulnerability to infection and violence.\n       The Alliance is the third CORE consortium organization of \n     concern. The Administration's own policy may prohibit this \n     group from receiving government grants because of its veiled \n     support for the legalization of prostitution. The Alliance \n     appears to be the vanguard of prostitution legalization \n     efforts through its many activities. In one instance, it \n     employs two highly placed associates of the Network of Sex \n     Work Projects, an outspoken pro-prostitution advocacy group. \n     In another instance, the Alliance purposefully organizes with \n     pro-prostitution groups. Nonetheless, USAID is working with \n     the Alliance to implement the Administration's HIV/AIDS \n     policy among faith-based groups.\n       The fourth disturbing CORE consortium member is the WCC. \n     With a reputation for more than half a century of unrelenting \n     criticism of the United States, WCC consistently seeks to \n     undermine American foreign policy.\n       A study published in 2004 by the well-regarded Institute on \n     Religion and Democracy surveyed WCC's public statements on \n     human rights over the past several years. The report \n     discovered that 21% of all WCC complaints about human rights \n     were directed against the United States and 43% were directed \n     against Israel, though WCC cited no human rights violations \n     in China. Apparently, WCC believes that China is not culpable \n     for any violation of human rights, while the United States \n     and Israel account for two-thirds of the world's violations. \n     This is a distortion of the meaning of ``human rights.''\n       Astonishingly, such propagandistic condemnation is not an \n     isolated incident. WCC issued a statement which linked the \n     tsunami in the Indian Ocean to the U.S. refusal to sign the \n     Kyoto Protocol on Global Warming. After September 11, WCC \n     General Secretary Konrad Raiser attacked the U.S. war against \n     terrorism as ``outside the rule of law,'' and claimed that \n     our anti-terrorism efforts have led to the ``harsh \n     suppression'' of the ``people's struggles for social \n     justice'' because they appear as ``potential manifestations \n     of terrorism.'' Raiser also dismissed the tragedy of \n     September 11, stating that it would ``create a sense of \n     solidarity in pain with those who had been exposed to the \n     structural violence of a global economic system which serves \n     the interests of a minority of rich people and countries.\n       Last year, three of USAID's CORE consortium members (CARE, \n     the International HIV/AIDS Alliance and the World Council of \n     Churches) joined with eight other organizations to produce a \n     so-called ``Code of Good Practice for NGOs Responding to HIV/\n     AIDS,'' which includes statements antithetical to American \n     policy. The document states that, ``In the context of \n     individual behavior change, abstinence, fidelity and use of \n     condoms all have a role to play in reducing HIV transmission. \n     However, it is critical that abstinence and fidelity are not \n     promoted as the preferred approach, with condoms as a last \n     resort, thereby stigmatizing [sic] condom use.''\n       The code also calls for ``the full range of prevention \n     options'' to be available to injecting drug users ``in a \n     manner that is free of judgment,'' including ``utilizing \n     [sic] non-injecting methods of drug use and effective use of \n     sterile injecting equipment.'' The code states that ``the \n     illegality and stigma associated with injecting drug use \n     invariably lead to discrimination against people who use \n     drugs and create barriers to accessing services'' and \n     protests the ``failure to protect the human rights of people \n     who inject drugs,'' linking it to the ``undermining [of] HIV \n     prevention efforts.'' If the sponsors of this code seriously \n     believe that legalizing drug use and making drugs and \n     equipment available--protecting the ``human rights'' of drug \n     users--will prevent the spread of HIV, then we cannot \n     understand why USAID would contract with these organizations.\n       Furthermore, the code advances the legalization of \n     prostitution, stating that ``the stigma associated with sex \n     work in many countries around the world creates significant \n     barriers to sexual health and HIV prevention efforts among \n     sex workers and their clients. . . . Supporting sex workers, \n     including through collective action, empowers them to \n     negotiate transactions, and address the health and social \n     contexts that increase their vulnerability to HIV \n     infection.'' Apparently, the code considers the legalization \n     of prostitution to be a way to improve HIV prevention \n     efforts.\n       Such policy statements are clearly contrary to American \n     foreign policy and offensive to a vast majority of religious \n     adherents the world over--though they are made by contractors \n     for the Administration's central faith-based response to the \n     HIV/AIDS policy.\n       Any reasonable pre-award evaluation by USAID of its \n     contractors should have confronted the records of CARE, ICRW, \n     the Alliance and WCC. If such an evaluation failed to uncover \n     the concerns we have enumerated above, we must question \n     USAID's procedures for selecting its contractors. We would be \n     most concerned, however, to learn that USAID had initiated \n     its collaboration with these CORE consortium members with \n     full knowledge of their policy positions.\n       U.S. government outreach to the range of faith-based \n     communities delivered by anti-American, anti-abstinence, pro-\n     prostitution and pro-drug use groups should not be allowed to \n     undermine the work of the Administration. Organizations \n     entrusted with taxpayers' money and charged with a mission to \n     represent our nation to people abroad must themselves \n     represent the values inherent in American foreign policy.\n       Thank you for considering these views, and for your work to \n     ensure that people of faith may participate fully in the \n     public square.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 45}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S001143", "text": "  Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby my friend and colleague, Representative Steve King. This amendment \nseeks to obtain information necessary for Congressional oversight of \nState Department activities, to ensure that the Congressional policy \nagainst prostitution and human trafficking for the sex trade is \nreflected by those activities.\n  The King amendment will assist the Congress in ensuring compliance \nwith current law. Specifically, this amendment would require a report \n(within 90 days) describing by name all non-governmental organizations \n(NGOs) which received funding for AIDS relief after the enactment of \nthe President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief or the United States \nLeadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 \n(Public Law 108-25). That law required that any recipient of funding \nunder the act have taken an official, public stand opposing the \nlegalization of prostitution.\n  Regrettably, many NGOs involved in AIDS-related work have promoted \nlegalizing prostitution, in the misguided belief that this will somehow \nreduce the spread of AIDS. In fact, promoting prostitution not only \nthreatens to increase risky sexual behavior and thereby worsen the AIDS \nepidemic, it also legitimizes this degrading ``business'' that has \nenslaved so many women and children in the Third World and elsewhere.\n\n\n  Despite the enactment of Public Law 108-25, we have learned that the \nState Department in fact awarded grants to NGOs that support legalizing \nprostitution. The Department has refused, however, to provide a \ncomplete accounting of this funding.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise to urge support of this amendment which condemns \nthe attacks made by radical Muslims since the Oslo Peace Accords in \nSeptember of 1993. These attacks claimed the lives of 53, at least 53 \ninnocent American victims and at least one unborn child in Israel.\n  My amendment is simple in procedure, but it is sincere in its \nsubstance. It honors those innocent Americans that have fallen victim \nto the terror of radical Islam by listing each victim's name, age, \nplace of residence, location of his or her death, and the cause of \ntheir death. My amendment also demands that the Palestinian Authority \nwork with Israel to protect all innocent individuals, regardless of \ncitizenship, from terrorist atrocities.\n  We should honor the victims killed by terrorists in Israel and all \nover the world with the same spirit that we have honored our victims of \nSeptember 11. The September 11 victims and those killed in Israel are \nall victims of radical Islam and, sadly, the death toll continues to \nrise as evidenced by the recent London bombings of July 7.\n  The terrorists who attacked us on\n9/11 are the same kind of terrorists who blow themselves up on buses or \nin\n\n\ncrowded shopping areas in Israel and kill our soldiers on the streets \nof Baghdad. Terrorism does not discriminate between women and men or \nbetween children and adults. This is because terrorists hate freedom \nand worship death. It is with heavy hearts that we as freedom-loving \npeople are bound together across language barriers and religious \nbeliefs. Together, we fight radical Islam which preaches a culture of \ndeath.\n  My amendment is a small, heartfelt measure to honor those Americans \nkilled in Israel by radical Islamists. I am hopeful that it will send a \nmessage to their loved ones that we are all in this together. Our fight \nto defend our God-given rights to freedom will honor those who have \ndied at the hands of the culture of death and properly preserve our \nfreedom for future generations.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment, Mr. Chairman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 40, "speaker": "Mr. KING of Iowa", "itemno": 58}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000090", "text": "  Mr. LANTOS.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The Kucinich amendment would require the President to direct the U.S. \nrepresentatives to the United Nations and other international \norganizations to commence negotiations on an international treaty \nbanning space-based weapons. Though the U.S. and the former Soviet \nUnion long dominated the use of space, currently many states are \ninvesting in space assets and have developed or are developing the \nability to use space peacefully.\n  Serious multilateral discussions about rules of the road for space \nare needed. This is especially important for the United States, as we \nown and operate the vast majority of satellites orbiting today, and \nspace has become critical to U.S. economic, scientific, and military \ninterests. Continuing the peaceful use of space will require refined \ninternational laws for space-faring States. The legal framework \naddressing the weaponization of space is far from comprehensive.\n  The international community, including Russia, China, Canada, and the \nEU, support creating a ban on weapons through a treaty to ban weapons \nfrom outer space. The United Nations has called for peace in space.\n  For nearly a half century, the cooperative and peaceful uses of space \nhave yielded immense benefits to humans worldwide. Despite Cold War \ntensions and the technical capability to do so, no nation has deployed \ndestructive weapons in space or destroyed the satellites of another \nnation.\n  The policy of preserving peace in space has not only been an \ninternational policy, Mr. Chairman, it has also been a national policy. \nThe National Aeronautic and Space Act passed in 1958 stated that it \n``is the policy of the United States that activities in space should be \ndevoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.''\n  Yet despite any amendment to law or consideration by Congress, the \npolicy of preserving peace in space changed significantly, behind \nclosed doors.\n\n\n  Why this policy has changed is a mystery. No other country has taken \nany steps to develop space-based weapons. Space assets of the United \nStates have received no national security threats. Our national \nsecurity threats are far from outer space. They are on the ground. Yet, \nwith little public debate, the Pentagon has already spent billions of \ndollars developing space weapons and preparing plans to deploy them.\n  The Air Force has recently sought President Bush's approval of a \nnational security directive that could move the U.S. closer to fielding \nspace weapons. This new policy would alienate our friends and mobilize \nour potential enemies.\n  Moving forward with plans to weaponize space would create an arms \nrace in space. It would be counterproductive to U.S. national security \nto give potential adversaries reasons to accelerate development of \nspace weapons technology. Pursuing space weapons would also bankrupt \nour Nation\n\n\nwith a hefty price tag of up to $1 trillion according to published \nstudies by leading weapons scientists, physicists, and engineers. The \nfinancial repercussions of a space-based weapons system would trickle \ndown to every sector of our society: our national security, economy, \nhealth care, education, social services, and foreign policy.\n  It would be very easy to prevent the inevitable catastrophe that \nwould result from an armed race in space. The United States, the only \ncountry moving forward with plans to put weapons in space, despite any \nnational security threat, would need to stop in its tracks and work \nwith other nations to negotiate an international legal framework for \nthe peaceful use of space.\n  Support the Kucinich amendment to commence negotiations for an \ninternational treaty banning space-based weapons. This country should \nnot make of the planet Earth a death star. We need to support \ninternational cooperation for the peaceful use of technology in space. \nSupport the Kucinich amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 52, "speaker": "Mr. KUCINICH", "itemno": 76}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "E000268", "text": "  Mr. EVERETT.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Opening doors to well-intentioned foreign students and \n     exchange visitors has wide-ranging benefits to the United \n     States.\n       (2) Upon their return to their countries of origin, foreign \n     students and exchange visitors disseminate the core values of \n     the United States as they relate their positive experiences \n     with the democratic form of governance, the dynamic \n     multicultural society, and the entrepreneurial spirit of the \n     United States.\n       (3) The United States earns approximately $13,000,000,000 a \n     year in tuition and living expenses paid by foreign students, \n     making higher education the United States' fifth largest \n     service export.\n       (4) Since the terrorist attacks on America on September 11, \n     2001, the United States institutions of higher education and \n     nongovernmental exchange sponsors have faced great challenges \n     in retaining their competitive position in the market for \n     foreign students.\n       (A) During the 2002-2003 academic year, the first year \n     after the 9/11 attacks, the growth of overall international \n     student enrollment in the United States slowed to 0.6 percent \n     after having increased by 6.4 percent in the two previous \n     academic years. During the 2003-2004 academic year, according \n     to the Institute of International Education, the number of \n     international students studying in the United States declined \n     2.4 percent to 572,509. This was the first overall decline in \n     international students studying in the United States since \n     the 1971-72 school year.\n       (B) Community Colleges have been particularly hard-hit by \n     overall declines in enrollments of foreign students. During \n     the 2003-2004 academic year, the number of foreign students \n     enrolled a public two-year schools fell by 10 percent, \n     according to the Institute of International Education.\n       (5) Some foreign students have expressed anxiety and alarm \n     about the new visa processes. A survey conducted in 2004 at \n     the University of California of 1,700 foreign students found \n     that 60 percent reported that they had to endure \n     ``unreasonable delays'' to obtain student visas.\n       (6) Competitors in the marketplace for higher education, \n     including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany and the \n     United Kingdom, are aggressively recruiting students to take \n     advantage of changed perceptions of the United States.\n       (7) If the United States is to regain its competitive \n     advantage in attracting foreign students and exchange \n     visitors, it will be essential for the Department of State to \n     work to ensure that new visa procedures are administered in \n     the most efficient and user-friendly possible manner. \n     Furthermore the Department must continue to engage in public \n     outreach designed to dispel negative perceptions about study \n     in the United States.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 98}, {"kind": "title", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "     SEC. 1103.

And we have made progress.\n  After the 1986 annex bill that allowed the States to work together to \nsolve issues of common interest, issues that Wisconsinites and \nMichiganders and folks from Ohio and Indiana understand are so \nimportant, this really reaffirms that. It says we believe that\n\n\nthese folks, including Canada, the provinces that touch the Great \nLakes, should have the ability to control water diversion. It is \nworking. We have gotten progress. We have come together. It was really \nthe first piece of legislation that brought Canada to the table to talk \nabout the issues important to all of the Great Lakes States.\n  Mr. Chairman, there are 18 Great Lakes Members that support this \nlanguage. The chairman supports this language. Why? Because we \nunderstand that 20 percent of the world's fresh water is worth fighting \nfor. It is worth protecting. But it is worth protecting in the sense \nthat we give the authority to Great Lakes Governors and Great Lakes \nlegislators for the purpose of protecting what they know. If you want \nour water, you really should have to live there in February. It is a \nbeautiful place. Beautiful lakes. Beautiful fresh water. And it is \nworth protecting. Let us not diffuse the issue. Let us not stop the \nprogress of the Great Lakes Governors and the Great Lakes legislators \nand the provincial leaders in Canada. We have made huge progress. The \nlakes are starting to turn around. We have identified mutual areas of \ninterest where we can make even more progress to keep those Great Lakes \nalive.\n  This is the amendment, Mr. Chairman, that says we will and we do \nunderstand the importance of the Great Lakes Governors and the Great \nLakes legislators making the determinations in accordance with law that \nhas passed these bodies several times before.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde).", "turn": 97, "speaker": "Mr. ROGERS of Michigan", "itemno": 146}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H001022", "text": "  Mr. HYDE.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, as someone who has worked more than 12 years to protect \nthe Great Lakes, I have serious concerns about this amendment and I \nwould urge my colleagues to oppose it. To be clear, I strongly support \nthe amendment's stated intent. Congress should encourage the Great \nLakes Governors to work together to develop a common standard for Great \nLakes water withdrawal. But there is little similarity between the \ngentleman from Michigan's stated intent and the real effect of his \namendment.\n  The Rogers amendment would, for the first time ever, put Congress on \nrecord as granting all management authority over the Great Lakes to the \neight State Governors and two provincial governments of Canada. In \ndoing so, it would undermine our efforts to protect the lakes from oil \nand gas drilling, wastewater blending, invasive species, and water \ndiversions. In short, the Rogers amendment would be a recipe for \ndisaster for the Great Lakes.\n  This amendment is absurd. Would Congress cede control of coastal \nportions of the Atlantic Ocean to a foreign government? Would we allow \nMexico the power to decide whether or not to drill for oil and gas in \nthe Gulf off the coast of Florida, Louisiana or Mississippi? The answer \nis absolutely not. So why would Congress cede management control over \nthe Great Lakes, the source of drinking water for over 33 million \nAmericans, to Canada or any other foreign power? If you vote for the \nRogers amendment, that is exactly what you would be doing, giving away \nour national sovereignty.\n\n\n  Current law already allows the States a great deal of input into \nGreat Lakes management. It strikes the appropriate balance between the \nState and the Federal Government. It is the right way to protect the \nGreat Lakes. It ensures that we have one smart policy to protect the \nGreat Lakes, not eight. That is why Annex 2001 requires congressional \napproval.\n  Specifically, this amendment uses the phrase ``remain vested'' when \nreferring to the Great Lakes States' management authority. Congress has \nnever provided full management authorities of the Great Lakes to the \nStates. How can the States ``remain vested'' with authority that \nCongress has never granted?\n  This language is not a minor detail. In reality, it would mean the \nFederal Government would be ceding its lead role in protecting the \nGreat Lakes to several States and to Canada. This is not a recipe for a \nsmart, coordinated effort to protect our Great Lakes.\n  As Members decide how they will vote on the Rogers amendment, I ask \nthem to consider the following: The Federal Government does have a role \nin the policies regarding the Great Lakes, just as we have a role in \npolicies governing coastal issues along our ocean borders.\n  If Members support the environment and want to protect our country's \nlargest source of fresh water, vote no on the Rogers amendment. We \ncannot risk having eight different policies from eight different Great \nLakes States.\n  If Members support the Constitution, vote no on the Rogers amendment. \nWe should never cede control of our natural resources to two Canadian \npremiers.\n  This amendment is inconsistent with constitutional interpretation, \nand could provide States more leverage to negotiate directly with other \ncountries on interests of national concerns regarding the Great Lakes. \nA simple reading of the Rogers amendment, especially the last \nparagraph, could only lead to two conclusions: Either the amendment \nfails to understand law or it is purposely attempting to undermine \nexisting Great Lakes protections.

Zhu made these comments in the \ncourse of threatening a Chinese invasion of the democratic nation of \nTaiwan. General Zhu Chenghu's comments are one of many examples that \nreveal China's hostile intentions toward both Taiwan and the United \nStates.\n  In 1995, another Chinese general, who is now the Deputy Chief of the \nGeneral Staff of the People's Liberation Army, told a former Pentagon \nofficial that China would consider using nuclear weapons in a Taiwan \nconflict, then warned that Americans should worry more about Los \nAngeles than Taipei.\n  Mr. Chairman, the U.S. decision to recognize Communist China in 1979 \nwas predicated on China's commitment to resolve its differences with \nTaiwan peacefully. But General Zhu Chenghu's statements, coupled with \nthe ``anti-secession law'' passed by China's rubber stamp congress a \nshort time ago, made it increasingly clear that China has no interest \nin adhering to this commitment.\n  These developments have caused damage to an already tense U.S.-China \nrelationship. My amendment would call on the Chinese government to deal \nwith General Zhu Chenghu the same way President Truman dealt with \nGeneral MacArthur when he made similar statements during the Korean War \nthat did not reflect official U.S. policy.\n  The amendment expresses the sense of Congress that the Communist \ngovernment in Beijing disavow General Zhu Chenghu's statements and \nremove him from his position.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Tancredo \namendment. I think it is high time that we brought this to the floor of \nthe Congress. I also associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Lantos).\n  We have a lot of broad international issues, and we are here debating \nthem on this floor. I have an issue that I think has not been properly \nheard, and I appreciate the time to address it. It is the issue of AIDS \nin Africa.\n  Mr. Chairman, I have traveled to Africa. First, I sat on this floor, \nand I believe the date was January 28, 2003, when about 10 feet behind \nme the President of the United States in his State of the Union address \nspoke to the issue of committing our resources to AIDS in Africa. I \nwatched as we had a standing ovation that was led from this side of the \naisle and with great enthusiasm I applauded the President's initiative \nbecause I had been reading the information on Uganda and the ABC policy \nthat had come from Uganda on AIDS prevention, which they had done \nwithout resources from the United States: Abstinence, Be faithful, and \nif those fail, then Condoms.\n  I went to Africa less than a year ago, particularly Southern Africa, \nand I went to the AIDS orphanages and to the hospitals and to the \nclinics. I met with the people distributing the anti-retroviral drugs \nand the condoms. I looked for the A, the abstinence, and the B, Be \nfaithful, and I had a lot of trouble finding its existence in Southern \nAfrica.\n  So when I raised the issue before a large meeting in one of those \ncountries in Southern Africa, and in that meeting I recall there were \n24 people, among them USAID people, Peace Corps people, Centers for \nDisease Control people, people from the U.S. Council and others, the \nteam that is administering the resources that are going to AIDS in \nAfrica. And I asked them, What are you doing about promiscuity?\n  Their answer was we cannot change the culture, so we are distributing \ndrugs and condoms.\n  But if they have a sexual life expectancy of another 25 to 30 years, \nhow many more people are infected? Can we treat our way out of this \nproblem, or must we find another way to solve it in conjunction with \nour anti-retroviral drugs?\n  Their answer was you cannot change the culture. But what they are \ndoing is seeking to change the culture by promoting condoms, not by \npromoting a lifestyle that will protect them from this disease. So we \nare not addressing promiscuity.\n  I will agree with the USAID, the Peace Corps, the CDC, and a number \nof others that are out there, sometimes you cannot change the culture. \nOur difficulty is changing their culture, not the difficulty in \nsupporting the people in Africa who have a culture that can be \nsupported that can help eradicate this disease.\n  So I call for that. I appreciate the work done by the gentleman from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Smith) as well. We have had good discussions on this. \nWe have some insight into this, and they are working with the gentleman \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Hyde), but I am asking sincerely that we can have \nsome hearings to have some insight into the actual results of the U.S. \nresources that are committed into Africa.

He bears great personal responsibility for the series \nof wars that have wracked West Africa over the last 2 decades.\n  The Liberian civil war was noted for its barbarism, and Taylor was \nthe most barbaric of the bunch.

The Special \nCourt for Sierra Leone has indicted Taylor on 17 counts of war crimes. \nAccording to the court, Taylor provided ``guidance and direction'' to a \n``joint criminal enterprise which was to take any actions necessary to \ngain and exercise political power and control over the territory of \nSierra Leone . . .

At all times relevant to this Indictment, a state of \n     armed conflict existed within Sierra Leone. For the purposes \n     of this Indictment, organized armed factions involved in this \n     conflict included the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), the \n     Civil Defence Forces (CDF) and the Armed Forces Revolutionary \n     Council (AFRC).\n       3. A nexus existed between the armed conflict and all acts \n     or omissions charged herein as Violations of Article 3 common \n     to the Geneva Conventions and of Additional Protocol II and \n     as Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian \n     Law.\n       4. The organized armed group that became known as the RUF, \n     led by FODAY SAYBANA SANKOH aka POPAY aka PAPA aka PA, was \n     founded about 1988 or 1989 in Libya. The RUF, under the \n     leadership of FODAY SAYBANA SANKOH, began organized armed \n     operations in Sierra Leone in March 1991. During the ensuing \n     armed conflict, the RUF forces were also referred to as \n     ``RUF'', ``rebels'' and ``People's Army''.\n       5. The CDF was comprised of Sierra Leonean traditional \n     hunters, including the Kamajors, Gbethis, Kapras, Tamaboros \n     and Donsos. The CDF fought against the RUF and AFRC.\n       6. On 30 November 1996, in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, FODAY \n     SAYBANA SANKOH and Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, President of the \n     Republic of Sierra Leone, signed a peace agreement which \n     brought a temporary cessation to active hostilities. \n     Thereafter, the active hostilities recommenced.\n       7. The AFRC was founded by members of the Armed Forces of \n     Sierra Leone who seized power from the elected government of \n     the Republic of Sierra Leone via a coup d'etat on 25 May \n     1997. Soldiers of the Sierra Leone Army (SLA) comprised the \n     majority of the AFRC membership. On that date JOHNNY PAUL \n     KOROMA aka JPK became the leader and Chairman of the AFRC. \n     The AFRC forces were also referred to as ``Junta'', \n     ``soldiers'', ``SLA'', and ``ex-SLA''.\n       8. Shortly after the AFRC seized power, at the invitation \n     of JOHNNY PAUL KOROMA, and upon the order of FODAY SAYBANA \n     SANKOH, leader ofthe RUF, the RUF joined with the AFRC. The \n     AFRC and RUF acted jointly thereafter. The AFRC/RUF Junta \n     forces (Junta) were also referred to as ``Junta'', \n     ``rebels'', ``soldiers'', ``SLA'', ``ex-SLA'' and ``People's \n     Army''.\n       9. After the 25 May 1997 coup d'etat, a governing body, the \n     Supreme Council, was created within the Junta. The governing \n     body included leaders of both the AFRC and RUF.\n       10. The Junta was forced from power by forces acting on \n     behalf of the ousted government of President Kabbah about 14 \n     February 1998. President Kabbah's government returned in \n     March 1998. After the Junta was removed from power the AFRC/\n     RUF alliance continued.\n       11. On 7 July 1999, in Lome, Togo, FODAY SAYBANA SANKOH and \n     Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, President of the Republic of Sierra \n     Leone, signed a peace agreement. However, active hostilities \n     continued.\n       12. The ACCUSED and all members of the organized armed \n     factions engaged in fighting within Sierra Leone were \n     required to abide by International Humanitarian Law and the \n     laws and customs governing the conduct of armed conflicts, \n     including the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and \n     Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions, to which \n     the Republic of Sierra Leone acceded on 21 October 1986.\n       13. All offences alleged herein were committed within the \n     territory of Sierra Leone after 30 November 1996.\n       14. All acts and omissions charged herein as Crimes Against \n     Humanity were committed as part of a widespread or systematic \n     attack directed against the civilian population of Sierra \n     Leone.\n       15.

In the late 1980's CHARLES GHANKAY TAYLOR received \n     military training in Libya from representatives of the \n     Government of MU'AMMAR AL-QADHAFI. While in Libya the ACCUSED \n     met and made common cause with FODAY SAYBANA SANKOH.\n       18. While in Libya, the ACCUSED formed or joined the \n     National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL). At all times \n     relevant to this Indictment the ACCUSED was the leader of \n     the NPFL and/or the President of the Republic of Liberia.\n       19. In December 1989 the NPFL, led by the ACCUSED, began \n     conducting organized armed attacks in Liberia. The ACCUSED \n     and the NPFL were assisted in these attacks by FODAY SAYBANA \n     SANKOH and his followers.\n       20. To obtain access to the mineral wealth of the Republic \n     of Sierra Leone, in particular the diamond wealth of Sierra \n     Leone, and to destabilize the State, the ACCUSED provided \n     financial support, military training, personnel, arms, \n     ammunition and other support and encouragement to the RUF, \n     led by FODAY SAYBANA SANKOH, in preparation for RUF armed \n     action in the Republic of Sierra Leone, and during the \n     subsequent armed conflict in Sierra Leone.\n       21. Throughout the course of the armed conflict in Sierra \n     Leone, the RUF and the AFRC/RUF alliance, under the \n     authority, command and control of FODAY SAYBANA SANKOH, \n     JOHNNY PAUL KOROMA and other leaders of the RUF, AFRC and \n     AFRC/RUF alliance, engaged in notorious, widespread or \n     systematic attacks against the civilian population of Sierra \n     Leone.\n       22. At all times relevant to this Indictment, CHARLES \n     GHANKAY TAYLOR supported and encouraged all actions of the \n     RUF and AFRC/RUF alliance, and acted in concert with FODAY \n     SAYBANA SANKOH and other leaders of the RUF and AFRC/RUF \n     alliance. FODAY SAYBANA SANKOH was incarcerated in Nigeria \n     and Sierra Leone and subjected to restricted movement in \n     Sierra Leone from about March 1997 until about April 1999. \n     During this time the ACCUSED, in concert with FODAY SAYBANA \n     SANKOH, provided guidance and direction to the RUF, including \n     SAM BOCKARIE aka MOSQUITO aka MASKITA.\n       23. The RUF and the AFRC shared a common plan, purpose or \n     design (joint criminal enterprise) which was to take any \n     actions necessary to gain and exercise political power and \n     control over the territory of Sierra Leone, in particular the \n     diamond mining areas. The natural resources of Sierra Leone, \n     in particular the diamonds, were to be provided to persons \n     outside Sierra Leone in return for assistance in carrying out \n     the joint criminal enterprise.\n       24. The joint criminal enterprise included gaining and \n     exercising control over the population of Sierra Leone in \n     order to prevent or minimize resistance to their geographic \n     control, and to use members of the population to provide \n     support to the members of the joint criminal enterprise. The \n     crimes alleged in this Indictment, including unlawful \n     killings, abductions, forced labour, physical and sexual \n     violence, use of child soldiers, looting and burning of \n     civilian structures, were either actions within the joint \n     criminal enterprise or were a reasonably foreseeable \n     consequence of the joint criminal enterprise.\n       25. The ACCUSED participated in this joint criminal \n     enterprise as part of his continuing efforts to gain access \n     to the mineral wealth of Sierra Leone and to destabilize the \n     Government of Sierra Leone.\n       26. CHARLES GHANKAY TAYLOR, by his acts or omissions, is \n     individually criminally responsible pursuant to Article 6.1. \n     of the Statute for the crimes referred to in Articles 2, 3 \n     and 4 of the Statute as alleged in this Indictment, which \n     crimes the ACCUSED planned, instigated, ordered, committed or \n     in whose planning, preparation or execution the ACCUSED \n     otherwise aided and abetted, or which crimes were within a \n     joint criminal enterprise in which the ACCUSED participated \n     or were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the joint \n     criminal enterprise in which the ACCUSED participated.\n       27.

The ACCUSED is responsible for the criminal \n     acts of his subordinates in that he knew or had reason to \n     know that the subordinate was about to commit such acts or \n     had done so and the ACCUSED failed to take the necessary and \n     reasonable measures to prevent such acts or to punish the \n     perpetrators thereof.\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 187}, {"kind": "title", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                CHARGES\n\n       28.

These attacks were carried out primarily to terrorize \n     the civilian population, but also were used to punish the \n     population for failing to provide sufficient support to the \n     AFRC/RUF, or for allegedly providing support to the Kabbah \n     government or to pro-government forces. The attacks included \n     unlawful killings, physical and sexual violence against \n     civilian men, women and children, abductions and looting and \n     destruction of civilian property. Many civilians saw these \n     crimes committed; others--returned to their homes or places \n     of refuge to find the results of these crimes--dead bodies, \n     mutilated victims and looted and burnt property.\n       31. As part of the campaign of terror and punishment the \n     AFRC/RUF routinely captured and abducted members of the \n     civilian population. Captured women and girls were raped; \n     many of them were abducted and used as sex slaves and as \n     forced labour. Some of these women and girls were held \n     captive for years. Men and boys who were abducted were also \n     used as forced labour; some of them were also held captive \n     for years. Many abducted boys and girls were given combat\n\n\n     training and used in active fighting. AFRC/RUF also \n     physically mutilated men, women and children, including \n     amputating their hands or feet and carving ``AFRC'' and \n     ``RUF'' on their bodies.\n     Counts 1-2: Terrorizing the Civilian Population and \n         Collective Punishments\n       32. Members of the AFRC/RUF supported and encouraged by, \n     acting in concert with and/or subordinate to CHARLES GHANKAY \n     TAYLOR committed the crimes set forth below in paragraphs 33 \n     through 58 and charged in Counts 3 through 13, as part of a \n     campaign to terrorize the civilian population of the Republic \n     of Sierra Leone, and did terrorize that population.

Charles Taylor remains a \nmajor source of instability for West Africa. Taylor has recently been \naccused of seeking to assassinate the President of Guinea. It is also \nalleged that Taylor worked hand in hand with al Qaeda operatives, \nhelping them to move their financial resources around using diamonds. A \nrecent ``Dateline NBC'' report details the al Qaeda allegations. I \ninclude this report in the Record:\n\n            Liberia's Former President, a Friend to Terror?\n\n                           (By Chris Hansen)\n\n                   [From Dateline NBC, July 17, 2005]\n\n       Even before the recent bombings in London, it was the \n     question many Americans were asking: Is our government doing \n     everything it should to stop terrorism?\n       A ``Dateline'' investigation reveals that some of the \n     world's most dangerous terrorists may have found a new safe \n     haven, a new source of money, and are thriving unchecked.\n       Have U.S. officials missed--or dismissed--a vital link in \n     the terror network?\n\n\n                        A global war on terror?\n\n       On September 11, 2001, President Bush put America's enemies \n     on notice: ``We will make no distinction between the \n     terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor \n     them,'' he said.\n       And in the days that followed, he defined who our enemies \n     are in the war on terror. ``Every nation in every region now \n     has a decision to make: Either you are with us or you are \n     with the terrorists,'' the president said.\n       He sent American forces to Afghanistan to destroy al-\n     Qaida's sanctuary. When he deemed Saddam Hussein a threat, he \n     sent troops to Iraq. He enlisted nations around the globe to \n     help target al-Qaida terrorists.\n       But some investigators fear al-Qaida may have moved into \n     another hot spot, one they say is fast becoming a terrorist \n     outpost: West Africa.\n       West Africa is a place most Americans and their government \n     haven't paid much attention to--war-torn, remote and \n     desperately poor. But that might be about to change. War \n     crimes investigators have uncovered evidence that al-Qaida \n     terrorists--before and after 9/11--were using West Africa as \n     a hideout and a place to launder money. And they say U.S. \n     inaction has allowed al-Qaida to move into West Africa.\n       ``Right now, it's a safe haven for terrorist activity,'' \n     says Al White, who for 16 years served as a senior \n     investigator at the Pentagon, handling sensitive intelligence \n     and law enforcement matters. ``They are actively setting up \n     shop. They're training in various countries over there. \n     They're recruiting.''\n       White says West Africa could become the next Afghanistan. \n     ``If we fail to act, and act soon-mark my words, that's \n     exactly what's going to happen,'' he says.\n       White says, those terrorists may be planning new attacks on \n     America.\n\n\n                 ``Mad Max Thunderdome'' in West Africa\n\n       For the last three years, White was on loan from the \n     Pentagon to the special court for Sierra Leone, set up by the \n     U.N. to prosecute war crimes that took place when Charles \n     Taylor was president of Liberia.\n       Taylor allegedly sent a rebel force into neighboring Sierra \n     Leone to seize that country's diamond mines, in a conflict \n     that resulted in the murder, rape and mutilation of 1.2 \n     million people.\n       And in 1998, White says, Charles Taylor went into business \n     with al-Qaida.\n       ``This man is a terrorist,'' White says of the former \n     Liberian president. ``He's also aided and abetted al-Qaida \n     operatives. Now he's actively working with these people \n     again. If we don't bring him to justice immediately, there \n     will be some significant consequences in the future.''\n       But why would al-Qaida flock to West Africa in the late \n     1990s? According to investigators, it's simple.\n       ``There was no accountability, there was no rule of law. \n     And so, it was literally Mad Max Thunderdome here in West \n     Africa for 10 years,'' says David Crane, who served as a \n     high-level Pentagon and defense intelligence official and was \n     that U.N. court's chief prosecutor.\n       He says al-Qaida found a friend in Charles Taylor who was \n     looking to sell the diamonds he'd seized in Sierra Leone. The \n     group turned to diamonds, he says, because they're virtually \n     untraceable--the perfect currency for terror financing.\n       Hansen: Do you believe that Taylor himself was personally \n     involved in these dealings with the al-Qaida operatives?\n       Crane: Yes.\n       Hansen: In what way?\n       Crane: Physically handing over diamonds for cash.\n       Hansen: And you have witnesses who have seen this?\n       Crane: Yes. We don't make this stuff up. This is stuff that \n     is told to us by our informants who have been living and \n     breathing in this area for decades.\n       Both Crane and White say they have developed information \n     that proves al-Qaida has been, and still is operating in West \n     Africa.\n       ``We've been able to positively identify ten of the 21 \n     FBI's most wanted terrorists, operating actively and freely \n     in West Africa, from 1997 up to modern day,'' says White.\n       And they say they have the witnesses to prove it. Witnesses \n     that include Charles Taylor's own brother-in-law--Cindor \n     Reeves.\n\n\n                           AL-Qaida presence\n\n       Reeves, who ``Dateline'' interviewed in disguise, is \n     currently in witness protection. He told investigators that \n     as a trusted insider, he escorted Taylor's special guests \n     around Liberia, including a man who went by the name \n     ``Mustafah.''\n       Although Reeves didn't know it at the time, he now believes \n     that ``Mustafah'' was, in fact, Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah, the \n     alleged mastermind of the 1998 al-Qaida bombings of U.S. \n     embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.\n       Cindor Reeves: I know the man. I didn't just see him one \n     day in '98. He came back the second time, he came back the \n     third time, and we stayed together for more than two, three \n     months.\n       Hansen: You're positive that this man was actually Abdullah \n     Ahmed Abdullah?\n       Reeves: Exactly. A 100 percent positive.\n       He says other al-Qaida operatives were there as well--all \n     with cash in hand to buy diamonds from Liberia's president, \n     Charles Taylor. Reeves told us the men first stayed at a \n     hotel in the capital, Monrovia, before moving to the safe \n     house. On the wall of the safe house is a photo of a familiar \n     face.\n       Hansen: And who did this picture turn out to be?\n       Reeves: Osama Bin Laden.\n       Hansen: Osama Bin Laden?\n       Reeves: Yeah.\n       Shortly after September 11, Reeves told his story to Doug \n     Farah, who at the time was a reporter for the Washington \n     Post.\n       Doug Farah: I said, you know, ``You gotta be kidding \n     right?'' He said, ``No, I knew--I know these people.'' And I \n     sold diamonds with them. And my first thought was, `Well \n     then, how would you ever verify this, right?' And I said, \n     `You know, I only have my reputation. You only have your \n     reputation. If you're lying to me on this, we're both \n     hamburger meat.' ''\n       Farah's article piqued the interest of officials in \n     Washington D.C. But the CIA and FBI said they found his \n     source, Cindor Reeves, unreliable. Still, the FBI, under \n     pressure from Congress, continued to investigate.\n       ``We couldn't establish that al-Qaida had in fact been \n     involved in conflict diamonds,'' says Dennis Lormel, who \n     headed the FBI's terror financing section.\n       What about all this information that Charles Taylor had \n     provided safe haven for some al-Qaida operatives?\n       ``We investigated that,'' says Lormel. ``The people around \n     Taylor and other people denied that that ever happened.''\n       But as ``Dateline'' discovered, one of the people the FBI \n     relied on to discredit the story was Ibrihim Bah, who Middle \n     Eastern intelligence sources tell ``Dateline'' has \n     longstanding terrorist ties of his own in Afghanistan, \n     Lebanon and Libya.\n\n\n                   The 9/11 Commission investigation\n\n       The 9/11 Commission, which conducted its own investigation, \n     agreed with the FBI.\n       Vice Chairman Lee Hamilton: Our conclusion, the conclusion \n     of the commission was that there was simply no persuasive \n     evidence of a link between al-Qaida and diamonds.\n       Hansen: We have talked to the chief prosecutor and the \n     chief investigator for the Special Court of Sierra Leone. \n     They remain adamant that not only were al-Qaida operatives in \n     Liberia but they were----\n       Hamilton: We don't deny that.\n       Hansen: That they were----\n       Hamilton: Yeah.\n       Hansen:--trying to do diamond deals with Charles Taylor and \n     others.\n       Hamilton: We don't even deny that. Trying to do is one \n     thing, doing it is another. We were not charged with the \n     responsibility of finding out what people were trying to do, \n     we were charged with the responsibility of finding out what \n     they did.\n       The commission's mandate was narrowly focused on the events \n     and failures directly leading to 9/11.\n       But Al White, who was the war crimes tribunal's chief \n     investigator says, when it comes to al-Qaida in West Africa, \n     the 9/11 Commission didn't look hard enough.\n       ``The 9/11 Commission missed the boat. I'll just be very \n     candid,'' says White.\n       White says the 9/11 Commission failed to interview credible \n     witnesses offered by the court.\n       ``How can you assess the credibility of someone you've \n     never talked to?'' questions White. ``That's what I find \n     suspicious. And that's what I find quite frankly \n     unprofessional.''\n       The 9/11 Commission says while it may not have interviewed \n     the court's witnesses, the FBI did, and that both the FBI and \n     the 9/11 Commission concluded they were not credible.\n       But could it be that the 9/11 Commission--along with the \n     CIA and FBI--just got it wrong?\n\n\n                        ``Dateline'' in Liberia\n\n       Mike Shanklin is a U.S. intelligence veteran. Now retired, \n     Shanklin headed the CIA's operations in Liberia in the 1990s, \n     at a time when Taylor was coming to power.\n       ``Dateline'' asked Shanklin, who had previously been \n     consulted by the special court, to come on our behalf to \n     Sierra Leone and Liberia to help sort out allegations of al-\n     Qaida's presence and diamond-dealing in the region. Together, \n     we uncovered evidence that U.S. officials appear to have \n     missed.\n       ``Al Qaida, Bah, Taylor, they were there,'' says Shanklin. \n     ``There is no question in my mind these people were there. \n     They were there during the period in question. And clearly \n     they were involved in some sort of a diamond business. That's \n     a fact.''\n       Ironically, Shanklin says, a few years ago, a top Liberian \n     security official--unaware that his boss, Charles Taylor \n     might have been doing business with al-Qaida--naively \n     launched an investigation into the terrorist group's \n     activities in Liberia.\n       But the investigation ended before it could begin.\n       ``Charles Taylor quashed it, said, `You don't need to worry \n     about this.' And that was the end of it,'' says Shanklin.\n       Several witnesses at the hotel (where al-Qaida operatives \n     are said to have met) confirmed to ``Dateline'' that al-Qaida \n     fugitives had stayed there as quests about six years ago.\n       What's more, a senior Liberian official told ``Dateline'' \n     that around the same time, a couple of unwitting Liberian \n     investigators apparently went to the hotel and tried to have \n     the men arrested--again, not realizing they were guests of \n     their president, Charles Taylor.\n       ``Taylor had the government investigators arrested . . . \n     and freed the al-Qaida operatives,'' says Shanklin.\n       Hansen: What does that say about the relationship between \n     al-Qaida operatives and Charles Taylor?\n       Shanklin: Well, it certainly says that Charles Taylor \n     didn't want these people under arrest.\n       What's most ominous is that the special court's former \n     chief investigator believes al-Qaida is still active in the \n     region. And he's desperately trying to convince the U.S. \n     government to do something about it.\n       ``They're here. They're absolutely here,'' says White. ``I \n     can't tell you the number. But, what I can tell you is that \n     there's a significant presence in West Africa. I don't know \n     exactly what the al-Qaida operatives are doing. That's what \n     concerns me. And, again, the problem is that's not my \n     mission. It's the FBI's mission to come over and find that \n     out.''\n\n\n                  Is the U.S. government doing enough?\n\n       There is one man who could settle the disagreement over al-\n     Qaida's presence and diamond-dealing in West Africa: former \n     Liberian president Charles Taylor.\n       Two years ago, after the special court charged Taylor with \n     17 counts of war crimes committed in Sierra Leone, the U.S. \n     helped broker a deal in which Taylor left office in Liberia \n     and went into exile at his estate in Nigeria.\n       Despite repeated requests from the international community, \n     Nigeria's president has so far refused to turn Taylor over to \n     the special court for prosecution.\n       And the United States--which considers Nigeria a vital ally \n     and oil supplier--has seemed reluctant to really press the \n     issue.\n       But Al White, who's just finished a three-year stint in \n     West Africa, says Charles Taylor is still conspiring with \n     terror suspects, and that bringing him to justice may be the \n     only way to prevent further bloodshed.\n       Al White: We've lost three years. Three years of time in \n     actively pursuing these terrorists. Can we afford to waste \n     another three years by denying that their presence is over \n     there?\n       Hansen: And what has al-Qaida gained in those three years?\n       White: [In the three years] they've gained momentum. They \n     have absolutely no problem pursuing their agenda and training \n     in West Africa because they're off limits.\n       Shanklin agrees: ``We're fighting a war and we're talking \n     about going after al-Qaida. We had an opportunity to go after \n     al-Qaida here. Maybe we didn't do it as aggressively as we \n     should have. Charles Taylor was dealing with these people. \n     And we should be doing something about Charles Taylor. This \n     isn't tough. This doesn't even fall in the category of tough. \n     This is pretty easy. Let's do it.''\n       There is new evidence that Charles Taylor may be meddling \n     in his former nation's coming election, and thus violating \n     the terms of his exile agreement. With that in mind, the \n     United States has joined the chorus of nations requesting \n     that Taylor be turned over to the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal. \n     Taylor's host, the Nigerian president, still refuses to \n     cooperate.\n\n  Mr. Chairman, these allegations are controversial, but what should be \nclear is that instability in West Africa creates a national security \nchallenge for the United States. Charles Taylor is a source of that \ninstability. Both the national security imperatives of the United \nStates and the cause of justice compel us to make sure that the policy \nof our government remains seeking Taylor's expeditious transfer to the \njurisdiction of the Special Court for Sierra Leone.\n  I ask the Members to please vote for the Watson-Royce amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 195}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000487", "text": "  Mr. ROYCE.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  I am pleased to join the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Watson), a \ncolleague on the Committee on International Relations, in offering this \nimportant amendment. As the gentlewoman has explained, this amendment \nstates that it shall be the policy of the United States to seek the \nexpeditious transfer of Charles Taylor to the Special Court for Sierra \nLeone so that he can be tried for war crimes.\n  Mr. Chairman, Charles Taylor has been indicted on 17 counts of war \ncrimes and crimes against humanity by the Special Court for the role \nthat he played in Sierra Leone's brutal war. This hybrid court, which \nhas been supported by this body, has been given jurisdiction over those \nwho bear the greatest responsibility for the atrocities and the human \nrights violations.\n  And those atrocities were, indeed, widespread. Human rights \nviolations there were grave. During the 1990s, then-President Taylor of \nLiberia supported what was called the Revolutionary United Front. That \nwas designated by the State Department as a terrorist organization. He \nsupported them in Sierra Leone, and they were notorious for hacking off \nthe limbs and the arms and the legs even of young children. When I \nchaired the Africa Subcommittee, we hosted some of those victims on \nCapitol Hill, child victims; and we held numerous hearings examining \nthe chaos in West Africa caused by this one man, Charles Taylor.\n  In May, the House overwhelmingly passed Resolution 127, and the \nSenate concurred, calling on the Nigerian Government to transfer Taylor \nto the Special Court. I still have hope; yet today, Charles Taylor \ncontinues to safely reside in exile in Nigeria. In August of 2003, some \nbelieved that removing Taylor from Liberia and giving him exile would \nprevent Liberia and West Africa from destabilization.\n  Instead of facing justice at the Special Court in Freetown, though, \nTaylor was given a seaside villa in Calabar, Nigeria; and in exchange, \nTaylor was supposed to refrain from political activity, but Taylor \nbroke that deal. So 2 years after the exile deal, Taylor is still very \nmuch involved in undermining Liberian politics as the nation prepares \nfor elections. He is working to undermine a peace process that has been \nsupported by the United States and Congress with hundreds of millions \nof dollars, and he said he will return to Liberia.\n  I believe, and I think my colleagues believe, that he is going to try \nto return because we remember his words. He said, when he got on that \nplane, ``God willing, I'll be back.''\n  Mr. Chairman, Charles Taylor remains a serious and continuing threat \nto West African peace and security, which is counter to U.S. interests. \nI am convinced that there will be no chance for peace in West Africa \nuntil Taylor is removed. We underestimate him at our peril, and it must \nbe the policy of the United States to seek the transfer of Charles \nTaylor to the Special Court. This has to be a pillar in our policy \ntowards West Africa. We need to press harder than we have been. \nBringing Charles Taylor to justice will help further U.S.-Nigeria \nrelations, help bring peace to Liberia, and strengthen the rule of law \non the continent.\n  It is time for Charles Taylor to face up to his crimes. This \namendment deserves the strong support of this House of Representatives.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 129, "speaker": "Mr. ROYCE", "itemno": 200}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000794", "text": "  Ms. WATSON.

The purpose was to \nprevent further bloodshed and to allow for a transition back to a \ndemocratically elected government in Liberia. The deal was struck in \nspite of the indictment of Taylor by the Special Court for Sierra Leone \nin June of that year on 17 counts of war crimes, including mass murder, \nsexual slavery, rape, hostage-taking, amputations, forced conscriptions \nof children and adults, arson, looting, and many other abuses of human \nrights.\n  Nevertheless, the action by the Nigerian Government likely saved \nthousands of lives and is providing at least a chance for free \nelections in Liberia in October. However, the deal was not without \nconditions, and there is ample evidence that Charles Taylor has \nviolated this asylum agreement.\n  For example, Taylor is alleged to be cooperating with international \nterrorist organizations. He is engaged in illicit trade in blood \ndiamonds in violation of U.N. sanctions and is linked to the \nproliferation of small arms throughout the region. He has also \ndestabilized the entire subregion of West Africa, leaving thousands \ndead and millions displaced in its wake.\n  Nigerian President Obasanjo refuses to end the asylum agreement, \nhowever, unless there is irrefutable evidence of violations by Taylor. \nI would point out to my colleagues that on March 17, Kofi Annan \nreported to the Security Council that Taylor's former military \ncommanders, party leaders, and business associates maintain regular \ncontact with him and are planning to undermine Liberia's return to \ndemocracy.\n  I urge strong support for this amendment. It is an outstanding one.\n  A few days later, Jacques Klein, the UN Special Representative to the \nSecretary-General on Liberia confirmed that Taylor is ``still very, \nmuch involved'' in Liberian politics.\n  Outgoing Chief Prosecutor for the Sierra Leone Court, David Crane \ncontinues to accuse Taylor of ``ruling the country from his house \narrest in Calabar'' In southern Nigeria.\n  So, yes President Obasanjo, there is plenty of evidence that Charles \nTaylor has violated the terms of his asylum. Has he continued to \ndestabilize not only Liberia, but also Cote d'Ivoire and Guinea? That \nhas yet to be proven in court, but there is enough evidence for him to \nbe sent to the court in Sierra Leone to find out.\n  President Bush raised this issue with President Obasanjo at a meeting \nin May, but U.S. policy must consist of more than a brief discussion. \nWhatever evidence we have must be shared with the Nigerian government, \nand then they must make up their mind if they want to continue in the \ndirection of helping West Africa to heal or if they want to close their \neyes to continued interference and further upheaval.\n  Surely, the time has come for Charles Taylor's reign of terror in the \nregion to reach its final, conclusive end.", "turn": 133, "speaker": "Mr. SMITH of New Jersey", "itemno": 204}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The Acting CHAIRMAN.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I want to begin by thanking the chairman, the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Hyde), and my dear friend, the ranking member, the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), for helping with this \namendment.\n  Since the 1993 Oslo Accord, the United States has given more than \n$1.8 billion to the Palestinians. In that same time we have given over \n$130 million directly to the Palestinian Authority. We have given this \nassistance despite no accountability, no modern financial controls, no \ntransparency, and no actual knowledge of where our taxpayers' dollars \nare going.\n  The amendment I have introduced, along with the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Crowley), would force the Palestinian Authority to be \naccountable, finally, for the money given by the United States. It \nwould also provide Congress with the ability to end the aid if the \ncertification requirements of this bill are not met.\n  My amendment mandates only 25 percent of direct aid to the \nPalestinian Authority can be spent in any one calendar quarter, instead \nof all the money being obligated at the beginning of the year. Each \nquarter the Palestinian Authority can spend another 25 percent of the \ntotal aid package as long as they meet the certification requirements. \nThe overall aid package remains unchanged.\n  The amendment contains a declaration of policy that the United States \nshould promote the emergence of a democratic Palestinian government \nthat denounces and combats terrorism; that works to eliminate terrorist \nincitement; that has agreed to respect the boundaries and sovereignty \nof all of its neighbors; and that respects the human rights of all \npeople.\n  If at some point during the year Congress is unsatisfied with how the \nmoney is being spent or if the Palestinian Authority fails to meet \ntheir certification requirements; if the PA has not taken concrete \nsteps to end terrorism; if the Palestinian Authority has not made \ndemonstrable progress towards democracy; if the PA has not dismantled \nthe terrorist infrastructure and ended incitement, Congress can stop \nthe flow of money.\n  If the Palestinian Authority lives up to its responsibility and \nhonors its commitment, then our aid to the Palestinians will flow \nunfettered, and in the exact same amount. However, if the Palestinian \nAuthority fails to live up to its responsibility and violence consumes \nthe region, if another intifada begins, if it turns out that our aid is \nused to fund Hamas, Islamic jihad, or other terrorist organizations,\n\n\nthen Congress should discontinue the aid. This amendment gives us that \noption.\n  To be clear, the amendment would not end humanitarian aid and \nassistance within the territories controlled by the Palestinian \nAuthority. It would not affect the overall amount of aid provided to \nthe Palestinian Authority. It requires the accountability that should \nbe a necessary component of foreign aid and that Congress should expect \nfrom all of those entities that accept foreign aid from the United \nStates and our taxpayers. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 176, "speaker": "Ms. BERKLEY", "itemno": 278}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "F000339", "text": "  Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is a two-page amendment. If it were a one-page \namendment, I would be an enthusiastic supporter. The declaration of \npolicy urging our government to promote the emergence of a democratic \nPalestinian government is greatly to be desired.\n  I must say the fifth item, insisting that it acknowledges, respects, \nand upholds the human rights of all people, if they would do everything \nelse here, respect the right of Israel to exist, repudiate terrorism, \nthat would be sufficient for me. We have some people we work with who \ndo not uphold the human rights of all people. But in general I like the \ndeclaration. I do not think, however, that we should impose these \nrestrictions on the funding.\n  This is an issue on which I trust President Bush and Prime Minister \nSharon. Those are not people with whom I am always allied. I believe \nthat Prime Minister Sharon, a political figure with whom I have not \nalways found myself in agreement, I have said if I lived in Israel, I \nwould not vote for Ariel Sharon. If he lived in Brookline, he would not \nvote for me. We can get along. Although I think he probably occupies \nmore of my thinking than I do of his. But I admire his willingness to \ngo forward with a policy that I think is very much in the interest of \nIsrael.\n  I, as an American Jew, and I will be in Israel in August and I will \nbe there again in January, I share the goal of a secure Israel as a \nJewish democratic nation, and I admire the insight of Prime Minister \nSharon and Deputy Prime Minister Olmert, that an Israel which governs \nmillions of hostile Palestinians will have a hard time being Jewish and \ndemocratic, and, therefore, I support Israel's effort to reach peace. \nThere is no guarantee that it is possible. It is a difficult situation. \nBut I do not think we in Congress should make it more difficult.\n  There are people within Israel who do not agree with what Prime \nMinister Sharon is doing, but they have not been able to get a majority \nin the Israeli parliament, the Knesset. I do not want to see them win a \npartial victory in the U.S. House of Representatives that they cannot \nwin in the Knesset.\n  While I agree with the declaration of policy, I believe that \nrestrictions on funding to the Palestinian Authority ought to be left \nto the decision of the executive branch. I trust George Bush on this, \nand I trust this administration. I believe they are as committed to the \ndeclaration of policy as any of us. And I think in this case it is \nimportant for them to have some flexibility.\n  I do not find the Palestinian Authority any model of democratic \ngovernance, but it is clearly in everybody's interest, and the Israeli \ngovernment agrees to this, to have the Palestinian Authority \nstrengthened vis-a-vis the terrorists of Hamas. Maybe the right way to \ndo it will be to cut back; maybe it will not be. I do not think that is \na judgment we can make here.\n  Again, when we have in power an Israel and a United States with \ndemocratically elected governments that are committed to this process, \nhaving these congressional restrictions, I believe, is a hindrance; and \nthis notion no more than 25 percent can be spent in a quarter does not, \nto me, have any substantive policy reason. Maybe there will be a joint \ndecision by Prime Minister Sharon and President Bush that the \nPalestinian Authority is in fact doing what it should do and they want \nto be able to give them more money in a period of time. I do not think \nit is appropriate for this Congress to restrict that.\n  So I agree with the declaration of policy. If we were in the whole \nHouse, I would ask unanimous consent that the amendment be modified for \nthat purpose, but I cannot do it in the Committee of the Whole, and I \nwould vote for that. But I do not think we should impose these \nrestrictions on the funding for the Palestinian Authority as a sign we \ndo not trust President Bush and the Government of Israel jointly to \nmake those decisions.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 177, "speaker": "Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts", "itemno": 279}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001231", "text": "  Ms. BERKLEY.

Now it is time for the \nPalestinian Authority to match its words with its actions and live up \nto its commitment to be a true partner for success and stability in the \nMiddle East.\n  Our amendment will tighten up language dealing with aid to the \nPalestinian Authority. Both the gentlewoman from Nevada and I believe \nthat we should be doing all we can to help the Palestinian Authority, \nbut that benchmarks need to be set in place. Over the past 10 years, \nCongress has had little to no accountability over the aid we have given \nto the Palestinian Authority. As aid from the United States begins to \nflow into the Palestinian Authority, we must use this aid to promote a \ntrue democratic government for the Palestinian people.\n  Mr. Chairman, our amendment would force accountability over this \nmoney and provide Congress with the ability to end the flow of funding, \nor quite frankly would allow the President to end the flowing and the \nfunding of this money if the certification requirements in the bill are \nnot met.\n\n\n  This amendment will make sure our aid to the Palestinian Authority is \ntied to the emergence of a democratic Palestinian government that is \nworking to overcome four important issues.\n  The first is that they denounce and combat terrorism and work to \ndisarm terrorists; secondly, agree to work to eliminate terrorist \nincitement, including their textbooks and what the children are taught; \nthirdly, agree to respect boundary and sovereignty of its neighbors; \nand finally, respect human rights for all people.\n  I believe we must have full accountability over the aid we give to \nmake sure that the emergence of a democratic Palestinian government can \ntake place.\n  As was pointed out, these are U.S. Federal taxpayer dollars being \nexpended. We want accountability as to how those moneys are expended, \nand there is a Presidential waiver.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance \nof my time.\n  I am always puzzled when in defense of an amendment we are told that \nit is really not going to mean anything. We are told the President can \nwaive it. Well, frankly, I think the purpose of an amendment is not to \nwaive it, W-A-I-V-E, but for some of us to wave it, W-A-V-E, as a sign \nof what we think.\n\n\n  I am all in favor of this declaration, but I think the amendment's \noperative part restricting funding might get in the way. The single \nmost important issue, it seems to me, is that the Palestinian Authority \nshould agree to disarm and dismantle any terrorist agency network or \nfacility. I agree that is essential.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer this amendment \nexpressing the sense of Congress that our government should recognize \nthe unique challenges facing Iraq's indigenous Christian communities, \nincluding the Chaldeans, Jacobites, Armenians, Assyrians and Greek \nOrthodox Christians.\n  I am a first generation American of Assyrian and Armenian descent. My \ngrandparents fled their ancestral homeland in the early part of the \n20th century. In fact, my mother received her First Communion in \nBaghdad in 1919. I am the only Assyrian American serving in Congress \ntoday, and one other did many years ago, the distinguished Adam \nBenjamin of Indiana.\n  There are approximately 250,000 Assyrian Americans in the United \nStates, representing the largest population of Chaldo-Assyrians outside \nIraq. All Chaldo-Assyrians are Christian. Because they are, they have \nbeen subjected to persecution in their homeland.\n  Today, there are between 1 to 1.5 million Christians remaining in \nIraq,\n\n\nmainly in the Nineveh plain in the north around Mosul. They live in \nvillages that can trace their history back over 2,000 years. And a \nlarge number, because of their geography, have now come under the \nauthority of the Kurdistan Regional Government.\n  Among indigenous Iraqi Christians, the Chaldeans represent the oldest \nrite under Rome. Along with the Assyrians who worship with the Holy \nApostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East, they represent the \noldest surviving Christian population in the world and one, without \nhelp during this critical transition period, that could be on the brink \nof extinction.\n  These communities have welcomed the opportunity before them since the \nfall of Saddam Hussein's regime to move toward greater prosperity and \nstability by cooperating in the development of a democratic, \npluralistic state. Unfortunately, religious and ethnic tensions as well \nas discrimination continue to plague these Christian communities. I \ncontinue to receive troubling reports from religious leaders indicating \nthat Iraq's Christian population is not receiving their fair share of \ndevelopment assistance. Because they are such a small minority, the \nindigenous Iraqi Christian population has one independently elected \nChaldo-Assyrian in the entire Iraqi National Assembly, Younadam Kanna, \nwhom I have met with and hold in high regard. Within the Kurdistan \nRegional Government in northern Iraq, representatives from Iraqi \nChristian communities hold five out of 100 seats. Because the Assyrian \ncommunity is so very small, such a minority in Iraq with one \nrepresentative in national politics, funding for reconstruction, \nhousing and education are parceled out to those who control the \nvillages and the regions where they reside without sufficient \ntransparency to ensure the proper parity.\n  The visible result of these misallocations has been the emigration of \nas many as 80,000 Iraqi Christians since the fall of Saddam Hussein's \nregime. The majority of these individuals, approximately 50,000, have \nfled to Syria, while others have spread out to Jordan, the Gulf \nEmirates and Turkey, all living in desperate circumstances as refugees \nfrom their homes.\n  This needs to be dealt with. If a fully functioning and sustainable \ndemocracy is to emerge in Iraq, the basic rights and needs of all \nminority groups must be safeguarded. My amendment seeks to affirm that \ncommitment by ensuring that all relevant U.S. Government agencies and \ndepartments pay special attention to the needs of this minority and \nensure that they will continue to reside and thrive in their ancestral \nhomeland.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I want to \nparticularly thank Tim Carey of my staff for the very hard, diligent \nand closely held sincere belief in this issue. Without him, I do not \nthink I would be on the floor today with this amendment.\n\nIraqi Christians Find Safety in Syria--Religious Violence Prompted Many \n                            To Flee Homeland\n\n                       (By Joshua E.S. Phillips)\n\n       Damascus, Syria.--Seated in his parish office, Father \n     Sarmad Yousef reflected on his hard choices: to disobey his \n     archbishop by remaining in Syria or to return to Iraq, where \n     his name has appeared on a death list. ``After the Americans \n     came, I was one of the people telling the Iraqi Christians \n     not to leave,'' he said. ``After the violence started, I \n     stopped telling them that.''\n       Christians all over Iraq face a similar dilemma as \n     relentless violence engulfs the country, some directly \n     targeting them. Staying in the midst of the threats is \n     dangerous, yet leaving means abandoning communities, church \n     property and a heritage with centuries-old roots.\n       Before the U.S.-led war, roughly 750,000 Christians lived \n     in Iraq, out of a population of 25 million. Most were \n     Chaldean and Assyrian, but there also were Armenian, Jacobite \n     and Greek Orthodox Christians and a small number of \n     Protestants. Most of them lived either in Baghdad or in \n     northern Iraq around Mosul.\n       Since then, 15,000 to 20,000 Christians have fled to Syria, \n     according to Christian groups, out of ``about 700,000'' \n     Iraqis, most of them in flight from the war, according to the \n     U.N. high commissioner for refugees.\n       Yousef, a 30-year-old Chaldean Catholic who came here in \n     August 2004, was the parish priest of Baghdad's St. Pathion \n     Church, with 800 families under his stewardship. Today, he \n     occupies a simple office in Damascus, decorated with small \n     portraits of St. Therese, the patron saint of his new church, \n     cradling a bouquet of pink roses.\n       He says he actively supported the United States when \n     coalition troops first entered Baghdad in April 2003 and \n     helped organize community meetings on their behalf. Such \n     support came with grave risks, and he narrowly missed two \n     drive-by shooting attacks. But when the Abu Ghraib prison \n     scandal came to light, Yousef says, his view changed. Nor was \n     he alone. ``Before that, Iraqis loved Americans,'' said \n     Yousef, his eyes lowered. ``Directly after that--those \n     photos, that scandal directly destroyed the dignity of \n     Iraqis.''\n       Muneeb, an Iraqi Christian parishioner of St. Therese who \n     didn't reveal his last name because he said he did not want \n     to attract local attention, said general resentment toward \n     the Americans was transferred to Iraqi Christians. \n     ``Americans are Christians,'' he said, ``so we're \n     automatically considered to be part of them.''\n       Christian-owned liquor stores and beauty salons were \n     attacked. While kidnapping has soared--both for terrorism and \n     financial gain--Christians felt particularly targeted since \n     they are often associated with successful businesses and \n     financial support of families living abroad.\n       With the rise of Islamic militancy, Muneeb said, his \n     sister, a doctor, was ordered to wear a veil outside her \n     home--a requirement that didn't exist, he said, when Saddam \n     Hussein was in power. ``I never thought of leaving Iraq,'' \n     Muneeb said. ``But as a minority, we have no support.''\n       Emmanuale Khoshaba, a member of the Assyrian Democratic \n     Movement, who regularly commutes back and forth to Iraq, is \n     more optimistic. Through his job as the movement's Syrian \n     representative, he promoted Iraq's Jan. 30 elections among \n     absentee voters in Syria.\n       ``Don't see the glass half-empty,'' said Khoshaba, who is \n     the organization's Syrian representative. ``Now, we have \n     rights: We have our names, we have members of the National \n     Assembly, and we have 35 schools that teach Syriac.'' Under \n     Hussein, teaching Syriac--the language used by Assyrians and \n     other Iraqi Christians, and one of the Middle East's oldest \n     languages--was strictly forbidden.\n       ``We have coexisted for thousands of years,'' Khoshaba \n     said. ``The problem was the repressive regime, and today we \n     are in a transitionary stage. But one has to stay and \n     sacrifice something for it.''\n       There have been many examples of such sacrifice.\n       One Sunday last August, a spate of bombings that struck \n     five churches in Baghdad and one in Mosul left 11 dead and \n     scores wounded. Yousef's church was spared, but he said Iraqi \n     Christians increasingly had started to leave soon after.\n       When Yousef took a previously planned trip to Damascus, he \n     learned his was one of 18 names on a death list. Thirteen of \n     those people had been killed the previous month. ``I decided \n     not to go back--I felt that I was too young to die,'' said \n     Yousef. He left behind friends, family and his parish. The \n     archbishop of Baghdad instructed him return to his post, but \n     he stayed in Damascus to fill an opening at St. Therese.\n       Yousef's new church, wedged within Danlascus' Old City of \n     cobblestone streets and crumbling houses, overflows with \n     worshipers during Sunday Mass. Of the 2,000 families now \n     connected to St. Therese, 90 percent are recent Iraqi \n     refugees. Just outside the church doors, a group of \n     parishioners from Yousef's old Baghdad parish discussed how \n     their lives have changed.\n       ``Life was better--we didn't have any problems,'' said \n     Jamila Tama, referring to the relative peace between \n     religious sects under Hussein. ``There's killing, bombing \n     and kidnapping. We have nothing now--even our house is \n     sold.''\n       Her son, Bassam Bahnam, was grateful for the haven in \n     Syria. ``But I have three boys who worked in Baghdad, and \n     they're all unemployed now,'' he said.\n       Bahnam and his family want to return to Iraq--when the \n     violence ebbs. ``Of course there's no place like home,'' said \n     his younger brother, Hisham Bahnam. But he criticized \n     Christian leaders' calls to stay in Iraq. ``They're asking us \n     to stay, but they're not giving us any solution,'' he said. \n     ``Even Christian leaders need an army to protect them \n     whenever they go outside.''\n       George Abona, a former priest who attended a seminary with \n     Yousef, agrees. ``When my Christian leaders say, `Don't leave \n     your heritage,' what are they going offer me?'' he said. \n     ``What will heritage do for me and my son?''\n       In Iraq, Abona worked for the United Nations for seven \n     years, before and during the war, and was in its Baghdad \n     compound when it was bombed in August 2003. He survived, but \n     the blast killed his brother, along with the top U.N. envoy \n     in Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello, and 20 other U.N staffers.\n       Then last October, he was kidnapped for 19 days. He was \n     released after another brother paid a $20,000 ransom. Despite \n     all that, he said, ``The security issue is not a big issue--\n     it's that I'm not ready to raise my son in an extremist \n     Islamic society.''\n       Syria has relaxed immigration rules for its Arab neighbors. \n     But aside from Palestinians, refugees are not allowed to hold \n     jobs in Syria, forcing most Iraqi newcomers to live off their \n     savings. Government assistance--especially health care--is \n     limited, and the refugees must return home periodically to \n     get their temporary visas renewed.\n       Yousef tries to provide his new community in Syria with \n     food and money for medical needs. The main reason he and \n     other Christians have fled Iraq, he said, is ``because we \n     don't feel it is our country any more.''\n\n\n       ``I have bad memories now,'' he said of events since the \n     invasion. ``Most of my friends were killed there, and we only \n     saw cruelty and blood. I don't think I'll ever be able to go \n     back.''\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nCardoza), who represents a very large community of Assyrian Americans \nin his congressional district.", "turn": 193, "speaker": "Ms. ESHOO", "itemno": 300}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "C001050", "text": "  Mr. CARDOZA.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment, along with the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. King) as well as the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nMenendez). Very simply, it deals with disseminating the truth in \nHavana, Cuba. Many have different opinions as to how this country \nshould deal with Cuba; and for the record this, in my opinion, has \nnothing to do with travel or trade or some of the more contentious \nissues that surround our relationship with Cuba. In my opinion, this is \nvery clear and unequivocal.\n  In Cuba right now, there are fugitives from justice. The reality is, \nfor those who do not know, Cuba is a haven or sanctuary for cold-\nblooded killers like Joanne Chesimard, who murdered a police officer in \ncold blood in New Jersey. She now goes by the name of Assata Shakur, so \nI am told. She is living peacefully in Cuba. The FBI is offering a $1 \nmillion reward for information leading to the capture of Ms. Chesimard.\n  William Morales is a bomb maker who was affiliated with the FALN \nterrorist organization that wreaked havoc not just in New York but \nthroughout the country. Victims of the FALN included three New York \nCity police officers, Detective Anthony Senft, Detective Richard \nPastorella, as well as Officer Rocco Pascarella. New York City is \noffering $50,000 for information leading to the capture of Mr. Morales.\n  And those two are not alone. The fact as we know it, while so many \nare oppressed under the communist regime, there are scores of people on \nthe FBI terrorist watch list who live peacefully in Cuba.\n  What this amendment does, very simply, is it empowers and encourages \nthe Havana section, the United States Interests Section, Havana to \nannounce the names of those fugitives believed to be living in Cuba and \nany rewards for their capture. Plain and simple, the Cuban people \nshould know that these fugitives live among them and they should know \nthere may be rewards upwards of $1 million of a bounty for the return \nof these fugitives to be tried in this country for cold-blooded \nmurders, for bombings, for hijacking, for air piracy, and scores of \nother crimes. The people of Cuba should know that.\n  I would hope that everybody would support a very simple message of \ndissemination of truth to the Cuban people and the swift return of \nthose fugitives who wreaked havoc on individuals and this Nation.\n\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 206, "speaker": "Mr. FOSSELLA", "itemno": 316}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M000639", "text": "  Mr. MENENDEZ.

I want to thank the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Fossella) for his leadership on it and the \ncosponsorship of the gentleman from New York (Mr. King).\n  I have, as the ranking Democrat on the Western Hemisphere \nSubcommittee, been for some time pursuing fugitives from the American \njustice system back from Cuba for several years. The case of Joanne \nChesimard is, of course, of particular importance to New Jerseyans, but \nI would venture to say to all Americans who believe in justice.\n  Thirty-two years ago, Joanne Chesimard shot New Jersey State Trooper \nWerner Foerster in cold blood. Castro's subsequent refusal to return \nher to the United States has left the Foerster family not only without \na husband and a father but with an open wound that can only be \ncompletely healed when Joanne Chesimard is brought back to justice.\n  Castro has turned Cuba into a safe haven for American fugitives. \nThere are many. There is a whole list from the FBI whose crimes have \nranged from air piracy to possession of explosives to murder. These are \nnot benign criminals, and they should not be allowed to evade justice \nany longer.\n  Ironically, Castro provides these criminals greater liberty than he \nprovides to his own people. These individuals, convicted in the United \nStates of horrendous crimes, are allowed to live freely in Cuba while \nCastro imprisons Cuban opposition leaders for nothing more than having \na different point of view.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment is simple. These fugitives will continue \nto enjoy the lives of freedom and liberty as long as Cubans are unaware \nof their presence or the rewards for their capture. This amendment \nsimply requires the United States Interests Section in Havana to \npublicize the names of these fugitives and make sure Cubans are aware \nthat there is a reward for helping them to bring these criminals to \njustice. The FBI is currently offering $1 million for Joanne \nChesimard's capture. Mr. Chairman, $1 million is a very powerful \nincentive, but the incentive only works if people know about it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to help bring some \nmeasure of justice to the Foerster family and the countless other \nfamilies whose quest for justice has been obstructed by Castro's \nregime.

Kosovo remains within the \nterritory of Serbia and Montenegro, and, therefore, citizens of Kosovo \nshould go to the appropriate place to obtain visa and consular \nservices, which is not prohibitive and, since it is only a 2-hour bus \nride, is certainly in keeping with most of the applications that need \nto be made by those seeking visas across the world.\n  The text of section 1019 is itself prejudicial, Mr. Chairman. The \nname of the province, in international use and the official U.S. use, \nis ``Kosovo,'' not ``Kosova.'' The term ``Kosova'' is a one-ethnicity-\nbased pronunciation of the name of the province. It would be highly \nprejudicial for the U.S. Congress to refer to Kosovo as ``Kosova,'' \nwhich by it would recognize and imply that the province is only \nAlbanian and would ignore the minority populations living there. \nAlbanians would have the same objections to the U.S. Congress referring \nto Kosovo as ``Kosovo-Metohija.''\n  Mr. Chairman, Congress should not send the wrong message at the wrong \ntime, and I urge support for this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 221, "speaker": "Mr. FRANKS of Arizona", "itemno": 334}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000090", "text": "  Mr. LANTOS.

Although the United States maintains a \nrobustly staffed mission in Pristina, those Kosovars wishing to visit \nthe United States must travel out of Kosova to receive consular and \nvisa services.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is both inconvenient and expensive for the average \nKosovar, who is not very wealthy, because many visa applications \nrequire multiple visits to a consulate outside of Kosova to places as \nfar off as Skopje, Tirana, and Podgorica: three different countries and \nthree different capitals.\n  The State Department says the current layout of the U.S. office in \nPristina makes it difficult to provide adequate security to handle \nconsular and visa matters there. The authorization bill, as written and \npassed by a vote of 44 to nothing by the Committee on International \nRelations, demonstrates the importance Congress places on providing \nconsular and visa services in Pristina and having the State Department \ndetail its plans for the future. It mandates no changes, but merely \nrequires the Department of State to report to Congress on the matter as \npart of our oversight responsibilities.\n  Nor does it threaten to change the status of Kosova, as some \nproponents of this amendment may believe.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, there is hardly a topic more misunderstood, \nmischaracterized, and exploited by America's enemies than the detention \nfacility administered by the United States military at Guantanamo Bay, \nCuba.\n  Mr. Chairman, we should be clear that the Guantanamo prison is \nreserved for some of the world's worst terrorists. Those there pose a \ngreat threat to our national security. Those there were primarily \ncaptured on the battlefield in Afghanistan.\n  Here are some specifics that the Department of Defense has stated \npublicly regarding Guantanamo. Since September 11, 2001, more than \n70,000 detainees have been captured in Afghanistan and Iraq. The vast \nmajority have been released. The U.S. is working with Iraq and \nAfghanistan and other governments to have them take control of \ndetainees from their own countries.\n  Some 800 suspected al Qaeda or Taliban have been sent to Guantanamo; \napproximately 520 of them remain. Approximately 235 have been released, \ntransferred or are presently in other countries; 61 are awaiting \nrelease or transfer.\n  So, who is in Guantanamo? Well, certainly no one under 18 years of \nage. That is important. The people who were there are terrorists, \nterrorist trainers, bomb makers, recruiters and facilitators, terrorist \nfinanciers, Osama bin Laden's bodyguard, and would-be suicide bombers.\n  And what are we learning from these people that are being held in \nGuantanamo? The organizational structure of al Qaeda and other \nterrorist groups; the extent of terrorist presence in Europe, in the \nUnited States and the Middle East; al Qaeda's pursuit of weapons of \nmass destruction; methods of recruitment and location centers for \nrecruitment; terrorist skills and how they use them; both general and \nspecialized operative training; and how legitimate financial activities \nare being used to hide terrorist operations.\n  Mr. Chairman, Lieutenant General Randall Schmidt recently headed a \nDepartment of Defense investigation of Guantanamo. General Schmidt's \nreport described how military interrogators at Guantanamo broke down \nSaudi Arabian-born Mohammed al Kahtani, who was to be, I might add, the \n20th hijacker on September 11.\n\n\n  By the fall, Mr. Kahtani had resisted all conventional interrogation \ntechniques, so Secretary Rumsfeld approved a more aggressive action \nplan, although a plan that still did not violate the Geneva Convention.\n  Ultimately, this prisoner started talking, and we learned how al \nQaeda, led by bin Laden, planned September 11 and the murder and the \nslaughter of almost 3,000 Americans. We learned how they recruited the \nterrorists and financed their operations, and how they entered the \nUnited States of America.\n  Mr. Chairman, unfortunately, common sense prevents a greater \ndiscussion of the intelligence windfall that was reaped by the \nquestioning of this particular prisoner. This case also shows that \npersistence and skill of our soldiers pays off. In short, intelligence \ngained at Guantanamo has prevented terrorist attacks and saved the \nlives of countless Americans and America's allies.\n  Mr. Chairman, no system is perfect, no group of people is perfect, \nour country is certainly not perfect, our defenders are not perfect. \nBut of some 24,000 interrogations, of those 24,000 interrogations, \nagain, it is not a perfect system, but only 9 of the 24,000 have been \nbasically found to have any type of abuse or purported to be examples \nof abuse. Most significantly, Guantanamo is not shrouded in secrecy, as \nwe are told over and over again. There has been enormous transparency, \nespecially as compared to any other country in the world which is \nholding terrorist detainees.\n  The International Committee of the Red Cross has been there. They \nhave 24/7 access to the facility, and it is at their discretion. The \nInternational Committee of the Red Cross had had a permanent presence, \nrecently changed at its choosing, and basically that is what the report \nsaid.\n  We have also had media people go to Guantanamo, including more than \n400 visits by 1,000 national and international journalists. We have had \nlawyers for the detainees there, especially in connection with habeas \ncorpus cases. We have had congressional Members, including 17 Senators, \n103 Representatives, and 129 congressional staffers. Now, if there was \never a case of openness and transparency in a place for holding \nprisoners, this is it.\n  Additionally, Congress has held at least a dozen hearings into this \nmatter.\n  Mr. Chairman, our distinguished colleague, the chairman of the \nCommittee on Armed Services, the gentleman from California (Mr. \nHunter), stated after touring Gitmo last month that he noted that the \ndetainees have gained an average of five pounds each over the last \nyear. They have received first class medical services, averaging four \nhospital visits per month, and that 100 percent of the detainees have \nbeen given a written notice of their rights, a written notice of their \nright to contest their detention in a U.S. court of law, as well as \ninstructions on how to obtain a free lawyer, and about 100 of the \ndetainees have lawyers at this time.\n  What other country in the world would be so generous at a time of \nwar, after seeing our people slaughtered in New York?\n  One military analyst, Jed Babbin, recently toured Gitmo and concluded \nthe following: ``The common belief among the terrorists, fed by reports \napparently conveyed to some by their lawyers, is that political \npressure will soon result in our having to close Gitmo and to let them \ngo. Critics are making the interrogators' job much harder than it \nalready is. Because they, the terrorists, are beginning to believe we \nwill close Gitmo, and many of the detainees resist interrogation'' \nbecause of this belief.\n  To the critics of Guantanamo, I would ask them, where do they suggest \nthat we put these people? What do they suggest we do if we end up \nclosing Gitmo? Where are we going to put those people we need to \ninterrogate? Where are we going to put, in this war on terror, where \nare we going to put those we capture? At Gitmo, the people there have \ndone a good job, a fantastic job, not a perfect job, and we should keep \nit open. It should not be closed, and we should actually congratulate\n\n\nour people who work there for the fine job they have done.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 254, "speaker": "Mr. ROHRABACHER", "itemno": 376}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000090", "text": "  Mr. LANTOS.

Otherwise, there would be no \nway to prevent enemies from returning to the battlefield.\n  There is, of course, an exactly parallel concern in the war on \nterrorism. We already know, Mr. Chairman, that a number of individuals \nreleased from detention have returned to the battlefield against us. \nThat is a fact.\n  It is also a fact, however, that the war on terrorism is unlike other \nwars that this Nation has faced. It is a struggle against deadly forces \nof extremism and nihilism which cannot be found in a bounded \ngeographical space or located at one particular base. And, as our \nexperiences over the last few years have demonstrated, our enemy is \nresourceful, able to adapt to new conditions, and the end of the \nconflict may be decades away.\n  In this context, the war on terrorism brings us to new ground. The \nfirst question we have to ask as we deal with individuals who \nparticipate in this global terrorist conspiracy is, should we treat \nthem with the propriety to which every human being is entitled? The \nanswer to that question is an unequivocal yes. There should be no \ntorture, no cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, and no humiliation.\n  In this context, Mr. Chairman, I believe that the U.S. military is \ndealing with a very difficult situation not of their own making and \ndoing a great job. I am not aware of a single detainee who has lost his \nlife at Guantanamo. I am not aware of a single detainee who has lost \nhis life at Guantanamo. Prisoners have been accorded nourishing and \nadequate food, quality medical care, access to the Koran, and visits \nfrom the International Committee of the Red Cross. And I believe that \nthe U.S. military has investigated abuses whenever they have come up. \nWe need to keep aggressive oversight, including trips by Members of \nthis House, to ensure that this continues.\n  Indeed, closing Guantanamo could well have unintended consequences. \nWe should recognize that Guantanamo is a safer and more humane facility \nthan the facilities in Afghanistan and in many places around the world \nwhere others are being held against their will. If we closed \nGuantanamo, where will the detainees go? We have already seen tragic \nincidences where their home country has tortured those who have been \nreturned.\n  A second and critical question, Mr. Chairman, is what type of process \nshould detainees get and how long can they be held without some sort of \ntrial. So far, all these questions have been addressed by both the \nexecutive and judicial branches, with very little involvement from the \nCongress.\n  For my part, I support the amendment, but I believe we need to have \nserious and thoughtful debate on how to deal with all of these \nfacilities.\n  This amendment relates to one aspect of this issue. Both here and in \nthe other body, we must begin to make our own judgments regarding these \nissues, and consider legislation as appropriate to address these \ncomplicated matters.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 257, "speaker": "Mr. LANTOS", "itemno": 380}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000409", "text": "  Mr. ROHRABACHER.

As the \ngentleman was just saying, the detainees, all 520 individuals that are \nthere, all 520 detainees have been found to be a terrorist.

They wish evil, and they carry out evil. We \nneed to keep them locked up.\n  We found that Guantanamo was a safe, secure facility.

I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his courtesy \ntoday.\n\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to commend my colleague, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Rohrabacher), for raising the important issue of \ndetention and interrogation of terror suspects here on the House floor. \nI firmly agree that the executive must have the authority to capture, \ndetain, and interrogate international terrorists to prevent future \nattacks and to process and punish those who have been captured.\n  Over a year ago, I traveled to Guantanamo Bay with the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Chairman Coble) and other Judiciary Committee members. \nWe toured the facility and recognized the critical work that our \nsoldiers are performing. It was also clear that important intelligence \nis being derived from detainee interviews, and our servicemembers have \ndone difficult and courageous work guarding some of the most dangerous \npeople in the world.\n  Nonetheless, Mr. Chairman, there is still a significant issue arising \nout of our Nation's policy of detentions at Guantanamo, namely, the \nlack of any congressional authorization or imprimatur upon the policies \nunderlining those detentions.\n  Last month I introduced Guantanamo Detainees Procedures Act of 2005, \nlegislation that would provide for the swift and deliberate processing \nand prosecution of detainees in that matter that meets all the \ncountry's national security needs and establishes due process \nstandards.\n  Over 500 detainees are currently held at Guantanamo Bay, most of them \ncaptured in Afghanistan after the U.S.-led invasion in 2001. Some \ndetainees have been there for more than 3 years without being charged.\n  My legislation would do the following: first, it would affirm that \nthe executive has the power to detain foreign nationals as unlawful \ncombatants. Second, it would provide for a timely hearing before an \nindependent military judicial officer to review the designation of \nenemy combatant. Third, it would require the government to bring formal \ncharges against detainees or to repatriate them to their country of \norigin unless there was substantial likelihood of torture, unless the \nSecretary of Defense certifies that additional time is needed to \ncontinue with the interrogation, that the person still remains a threat \nto the United States, and that by the bringing of formal charges it \nwould curtail the intelligence gathering process.\n  Finally, it requires the Department of Defense to put the cases \nbefore tribunals that operate under clear standards and procedures. \nFinally, it would require annual reports to Congress on the status of \nall detainees.\n  Recently, I have been heartened by the bipartisan calls from Members \nof the Senate upon the Congress to forge legislation which specifically \naddresses the standards and procedures to be followed for military \ndetainees. Frankly, I am surprised there are not more voices in \nCongress raising this issue that are not demanding that Congress act to \nset limits, not only in the detention of foreign nationals, but as in \nthe case with Jose Padilla and Hamdi, on Americans or those that are \nlawfully residing in this country.\n  But I have found a new and powerful ally in the United States Supreme \nCourt. As many know, the district and appellate courts have reached \nconflicting results about whether the executive's power to detain enemy \ncombatants and under what conditions those powers can be used. Justice \nScalia, in one of his dissenting opinions, commented, ``I frankly do \nnot know whether the tools are sufficient to meet the government's \nsecurity needs, including the need to obtain intelligence through \ninterrogation. It is far beyond my competence or the Court's competence \nto determine that, but it is not beyond Congress's.''\n  We could not have, I think, a stronger admonition that we need to act \nin Congress. And I would ask my colleagues to consider legislation \nrather than the piecemeal decision-making by the courts. Article I, \nsection 8 of the Constitution provides that the Congress, and not the \nPresident, has the power to make rules concerning captures on land and \nwater, to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into \nexecution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested in the \nConstitution in the Government of the United States, define and punish \noffenses against the law of nations and to constitute tribunals.\n  Mr. Chairman, a sense of Congress is good, but not enough. I urge my \ncolleagues to examine my proposed legislation, a proposal that would \naffirm the executive's authority to detain foreign national terror \nsuspects, but provide for the swift and deliberate processing and \nprosecution of detainees in a manner that protects our Nation and \nexpresses our commitment to the rule of law. The Guantanamo Detainees \nProcedures Act of 2005 will ensure that the hallmark of our democracy \nis not compromised.", "turn": 265, "speaker": "Mr. SCHIFF", "itemno": 389}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000409", "text": "  Mr. ROHRABACHER.

They have gained weight. They \nhave medical attention. They have regular meals, none of which they \nwould have had if they would not have been captured. And life in their \ncell is probably a lot better than the cave in which they used to live. \nAnd perhaps as well, we need to say that the leaders, the people who \nhold power over them at Guantanamo are at least directed and guided by \nmoral restrictions that are far different than those restrictions \nplaced on them by their former leaders who followed radical Islam.\n  The people who used to be their boss and hold authority over them, \nthe radical Islamist leaders, would cut people's heads off, participate \nin torture, not to mention of course send them out and send their \nfamilies out on suicide missions. No, those people that we have \ncaptured that are in Guantanamo are better off because they are under \nour authority rather than those people they used to work for.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nSmith), the chairman of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the \nInternational Relations Committee, as well as the co-chairman of the \nInternational Relations Committee.", "turn": 266, "speaker": "Mr. ROHRABACHER", "itemno": 390}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000522", "text": "  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, let me just say to my colleagues, the July 7 attacks in \nLondon, I believe, served as a chilling reminder of what is at stake in \nthe global war against terrorism. We must fight this war, a war that we \nnever sought, but which has been declared against our country and \nagainst our citizens; and we must fight in a way so as to win.\n  The amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. \nRohrabacher) underscores the resolve to do just that. Since the first \nprisoners were brought to the Naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in \nJanuary of 2002, this base has provided a secure location for holding \nterrorists captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan and from the many \nother places around the globe where we have obtained custody of \nsuspected terrorists. It has provided a place where these people could \nbe kept from returning to combat.\n  The gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) a moment ago talked \nabout the 12 detainees who were released and then returned to combat; \ntwo, I understand, in Afghanistan; and at least one that was killed in \na firefight. We are talking about terrorists who went right back to \nattempts to kill Americans.\n  Mark Jacobson, a former special assistant for detainee policy at the \nDepartment of Defense, estimated that as many as 25 of the 202 released \nhad taken up arms again.\n  For example, Mullah Shahzada, a former Taliban field commander who \napparently convinced officials at Guantanamo that he had sworn off \nviolence, was freed in 2003, and immediately rejoined the Taliban. He \nwas subsequently killed in battle in the summer of 2004 in Afghanistan. \nMaulvi Ghafar, a Taliban commander captured in 2001, was released in \nFebruary 2004. He was subsequently killed in a shootout with Afghan \ngovernment forces in September 2004. Abdullah Mesud, a Pakistani who \nwas captured fighting alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan, bragged \nthat he was able to hide his true identity for two years at Guantanamo \nbefore being released in March 2004. He was considered a low-risk \nsecurity threat because of his artificial leg. After retuning to \nPakistan, Mesud led a group of Islamic militants--part of a campaign \nagainst\n\n\nthe Pakistani government--that kidnapped two Chinese engineers working \non a dam. One of the engineers and several militants were subsequently \nkilled in a government raid. Mesud is still at large.\n  Mr. Chairman, Guantanamo is a place where crucial intelligence could \nbe gathered that could help the United States understand the operating \nmethods, patterns, financing, tactical skills and training of these \nterrorists. This information is critical to preventing future terrorist \nattacks and, in the long run, critical to developing a strategic vision \nfor combating this new enemy.\n  At the same time, Mr. Chairman, those who are held in Guantanamo must \nbe treated, without exception, humanely. There must be zero tolerance \nfor torture or degrading or inhumane or cruel treatment, and Congress \ndoes have a moral responsibility to ensure that that is the case. And \nI, like many of my colleagues, have gone down to Guantanamo to see for \nmyself, to provide oversight, to ask the tough questions and to try to \nget answers to those questions.\n  I would point out to my colleagues as well that in last year's \ndefense authorization bill, Public Law 108-375, this body unambiguously \nstated that it is the sense of Congress that, and I quote it, ``no \ndetainee shall be subject to torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading \ntreatment or punishment that is prohibited by the Constitution, laws or \ntreaties of the United States.''\n  Moreover, that law requires the Secretary of Defense to take steps to \nensure that policies are adopted to ensure the humane treatment of \ndetainees and that all DOD commanders have adequate training regarding \nthe law of war and Geneva Convention obligations, and that standard \noperating procedures regarding detainees be established.\n  Mr. Chairman, finally, just let me say that the U.S. must continue to \nfight this war on terrorism on every front. We must not let complacency \nlead us to lower our guard. We must fight this war in a way that is \nconsistent, however, with fundamental principles.\n  And I think the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) has \noffered us a resolution that tries to make that clear.", "turn": 267, "speaker": "Mr. SMITH of New Jersey", "itemno": 391}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B000574", "text": "  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  I appreciate what was just presented by my colleague from California \n(Mr. Schiff), who has offered up a legislative approach to deal with \nthe framework for Guantanamo, providing protections and procedures and \nmoving forward with dealing with the problems of enemy combatants. I \nfind somewhat ironic the continued portrayal on the part of some that \nwhat we have in Guantanamo now is sort of a Motel 6 with enhanced \nsecurity and better food than our kids get when they go off to school.\n  I wish that the resolution that was before us today were based on \nsome aggressive work on our oversight committee in the Committee on \nInternational Affairs, which my colleague, the gentleman from \nCalifornia, chairs, because I think it is appropriate for us to \nunderstand not just the treatment at Guantanamo, but what impact that \nhas had around the world in terms of perceptions of United States \nbehavior towards enemy combatants.\n  I mentioned that I am deeply, deeply concerned about the language \nthat is here that asserts that somehow we are better off and more \nsecure as a result of Guantanamo. There is nothing, nothing that is \nunique to that location and the lawful exercise of interrogation \ntechniques that is unique to Guantanamo. Where do we put them? We can \nput them in Leavenworth. We have lots of facilities that could be used \nto secure the enemy and protect the public.\n  But I am deeply, deeply concerned that there is lots of evidence that \nwe have fallen short of the mark, and it is not just that when you \ntorture and abuse people you get information that is suspect. The \nreason we reject that behavior as a country is twofold: besides being \nmorally wrong, it puts Americans at risk. If we are going to abuse \npeople, and recall that famous hearing in the other body when questions \nwere put to uniform command, ``would you like American soldiers \nsubjected to these techniques?'' Well, of course he would not. That is \nwhy we set standards to protect American soldiers and Americans \noverseas.\n  Second, when there are activities where we fail to meet our high \nstandards, whether at Guantanamo or Abu Ghraib, they have an incendiary \neffect. Remember, it was not just a Newsweek story that sparked the \nriots in Pakistan. We were told, in fact, by people there that the \nstory about the Koran being flushed down the toilet was not why the \nriots occurred. But the point is that there was a perception of \nAmerican behavior that made people susceptible to thinking the worst. \nThat is why there are a wide number of Republicans, including Senator \nMartinez, Senator Graham, Senator Hagel, that have raised questions \nabout whether or not Guantanamo has outlived its usefulness for us.\n  I would suggest, Mr. Chairman, that when the history of this period \nof time is written, we are going to find out in the last 4 years that \nthe information that came from the press, whether it is about prison \nabuses, about the basis for rushing to war in Iraq, or the consequences \nof that act, that the press accounts were more accurate than what we \nwere given from the administration as information and justification. \nAnd, frankly, Congress has been, in the main, missing in action when it \ncomes to getting on top of those stories, rooting out the truth, \nholding people accountable, not low-level guards ill trained and ill \nsuited, and looking at patterns of abuse that started in Guantanamo, \nended up in Iraq.\n\n\n  These are items that lend itself to the legislative process. With all \ndue respect to my colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. \nRohrabacher), it is not at all clear that what happened in Guantanamo \nmakes us safer given the fact that we have seen an explosion, that was \na poor choice of words, of terrorist acts around the world, including \nour closest ally, Great Britain, just this last week.\n  This is precisely what we should be doing as a Congress rather than \nrushing to approve a feel-good amendment that has not been carefully \nexamined by our oversight committee where there is evidence to the \ncontrary that we may not be safer rather than doing something that \nwould look to all the world as sort of a whitewash of what has happened \nin Guantanamo.

Approximately 520 remain and 61 are \nawaiting release or transfer. Who are these people?\n  Well, they are terrorist trainers. They are bomb makers. They are \nrecruiters and facilitators. They are terrorist financiers, and they \nare would-be suicide bombers.\n  What have we learned from the interrogations of the detainees? This \nis what we have learned. We have learned\n\n\nthe organizational structure of al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. We \nhave learned the extent of terrorist presence in Europe, the United \nStates, the Middle East. We have learned about al Qaeda's pursuit of \nweapons of mass destruction. We have learned the methods of recruitment \nand locations of recruitment centers.

I know that he is a man of great sincerity and he offers \nthis from his point of view in the right way.\n  But the interesting thing about it from my perspective is it gives us \nan opportunity to talk about some of these issues and this opportunity \nis a rare opportunity indeed.\n  It is unfortunate that it is so rare that we have an opportunity on \nthis floor in the context of legislation to talk about the tragedy in \nIraq and the so-called global war on terrorism. In this regard and the \ncontext of this amendment which focuses attention on the activities in \nGuantanamo Bay and pretends that all of those activities are upstanding \nand lawful, and in the language of the amendment ``lawful, humane \ninterrogation,'' we find in experience that this interrogation that has \nbeen carried out as a result of this so-called war on terrorism has \noften not been lawful and not been humane. It has not been lawful in \nthe sense that it has violated the third Geneva Convention.\n  It has not been lawful in the sense that it has violated other \naspects of international law, including the United Nations, and it has \nviolated our own domestic law frequently.\n  In Guantanamo, and even more so in other places such as Abu Ghraib \nand Camp Cropper and Bagram Air Base where the interrogation carried \nout has been unlawful, has been inhumane and has brought us terrible, \ndeep disgrace in the face of the rest of the world and placed a \nterrible burden on our country and our military people around the \nworld.\n  How did this all happen? We know that a significant number of \nmilitary personnel, both enlisted and officers, have been prosecuted \nand convicted as a result of the inhumane treatment that has been \ncarried on in these camps.\n  How did it occur? We are led to believe, we are being asked to \nbelieve that just a handful of inexperienced, rough hewn Americans \ninvented these activities indiscriminately in several different places \nby themselves, that this was not done in any concerted way. But the \ncircumstantial evidence that we have is quite different. And I say \ncircumstantial evidence because this Congress has abandoned its \nresponsibility to investigate this matter.\n  There have been inadequate hearings by this House of Representatives \nto look into this issue to see exactly what has been going on. But the \ncircumstantial evidence that we have indicates that these orders for \nthis kind of ill-treatment came out of the Secretary of Defense, \ntransmitted to the Under Secretary for Intelligence, Stephen Cambone. \nHe was then sent down to Guantanamo and gave the information to \nGeoffrey Miller. And he then carried it out in Guantanamo and then in \nCamp Cropper and in other places throughout the system that has been \ndeveloped as a result of this illegal, unjust and unnecessary war in \nIraq which has corrupted the focus of our legitimate attention, which \nis the attack of the al Qaeda terrorists on this country on September \n11, 2001.\n  We have abandoned all of that for the sake of this illegal, unjust, \nunnecessary war in Iraq which has now placed such a terrible burden, \npsychologically, emotionally and financially, on this country. So this \nresolution that we have here gives us an opportunity to examine these \nissues, and to examine them carefully, but to examine them in the way \nthat they need to be examined. We need the leadership here in the House \nof Representatives, the chairmen of the appropriate committees, to \nbegin hearings as to what exactly happened and why it happened, who \ngave the orders, under what circumstances were those orders given, to \nwhom were they given, why was this activity of persecution and torture \nwhich has been criticized by the International Committee on the Red \nCross, internally by an independent Army investigation and also on \nnumerous occasions by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n  We need to get to the bottom of this.

And we are clearly doing that. And, two, to conduct \ninterrogations against standards set by the civilian leadership of this \ncountry to glean from these detainees whatever information they have \nleft to help us with conducting this war on terror. Both those missions \nare being accomplished well.\n  We have great leadership there, and the men and women who are serving \nthere. Some 10,000 of our soldiers, sailors, and Marines who have \ncirculated through, have undergone extensive training, sensitivity \ntraining, which is a phrase I hate, but training to allow them to be \nmore sensitive to the Arab culture. Not to the Islam religion, which we \nought to respect, have respect for the Koran and the religious \npractices, but the customs of the Arabs are respected in a way that \ndoes us honor, because we are going to such great extent to accommodate \nthese detainees.\n  We cannot out-nice the meanness and the hatred of our enemies.

There is something to that.\n  My good friend stood here and said that an amputee that we nursed \nback to health was sent back to do harm. None of us who understand the \nlaw would in any way concede that we should have let him out. But the \nproblem is that we have no system of justice that allows us to indict, \nto try and to convict and to detain. That is what the American people \nneed to understand. We have individuals there that have had no process, \nno opportunity for the intervention of the courts, no opportunity for \nappeal, and no opportunity for us to convict and try and hold. And when \nI say convict, I mean indict, try, and hold.\n  So the report that just came out and was just issued that we need to \nunderstand, written in the article on July 14, unfortunately, we have \nnot gotten to the source. We are holding young recruits or young \nReservists as, if you will, responsible for Abu Ghraib, when we know \none of the chief designers of that was Secretary Rumsfeld, who signed \nthe document that allowed them to do that kind of interrogating of one \nof the 9/11 bombers, if you will.\n  It is important for the American people to know that all of these \npeople here are not related to 9/11 per se. They may be Taliban \nmembers. They may have been gathered up in a big sweep in Afghanistan, \nyoung kids who came in at 17 and now are 21. So there needs to be a \nprocess by which we deal with this.\n\n\n  I finish on this: the Geneva Convention, which we ignore, says: \n``Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and \ndegrading treatment, is outlawed.'' We need to understand that we can \ndetain people properly, we can have due process, and we can have \nindictments and we can have convictions; but we cannot have what is \ngoing on in Guantanamo Bay that leads to an Abu Ghraib. We must \nunderstand that we are better than that.", "turn": 280, "speaker": "Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas", "itemno": 404}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000409", "text": "  Mr. ROHRABACHER.

Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me \nthis time, and I would like to rise in strong support of the \nRohrabacher amendment arguing that our facility in Guantanamo is \nessential to the defense of the U.S. and our coalition partners.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Guantanamo Bay facility currently houses some of \nthe elite of our enemy's crop in the war against terror, including \nenemy combatants ranging from terrorist trainers and recruiters to \nbombmakers to would-be suicide bombers and terrorist financiers.\n  Guantanamo provides a strategic interrogation center where these \nenemy combatants can be questioned and where the results of the \ninterrogations have produced information that has saved the lives of \nU.S. and coalition forces in the field, as well as has thwarted threats \nposed to innocent civilians in this country and indeed throughout the \nworld.\n  Through the detainees held at this facility, we have learned about \nthe detonation systems used in roadside bombs in Iraq, bombs that have \nbeen used by the insurgency to kill our troops and innocent Iraqi \ncitizens. Detainees include some of Osama bin Laden's personal \nbodyguards and one of the suspected 20 hijackers in the 9/11 attacks.\n  Closing Guantanamo Bay, as some of our colleagues have suggested, \nwill not relieve the United States of needing a facility to house and \ninterrogate suspected terrorists. Should Guantanamo close, the \ngovernment would have to relocate those functions. Furthermore, given \nthe history of al Qaeda and the jihadists, the closure of Guantanamo \nwould provide an enormous boost in morale to the terrorists and their \nsupporters.\n  Finally, detainees held at Guantanamo pose a significant threat to \nAmericans, to U.S. allies and civilians in their home countries. There \nare reports of detainees released from Guantanamo, returned to their \nhome countries, only to resume terrorist activities and attacks against \nthe U.S., our allies, and innocent civilians.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues strongly to support the \nRohrabacher amendment.", "turn": 284, "speaker": "Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN", "itemno": 408}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000409", "text": "  Mr. ROHRABACHER.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. Chairman, the operative elements here before us in the resolution \nare twofold: one, on the second page of this amendment, there is \nparagraph 8 that says that we have improved the security of the United \nStates and that what is going on at Guantanamo is essential to fighting \nthe global war on terrorism. The second operative phrase is on the very \nlast paragraph, it is essential to the security of the United States \nthat we continue operating this facility until we are through waging \nthe war on terrorism, which I have already pointed out we have been \nfighting now longer than World War II.\n  It is not at all clear that the symbol that Guantanamo has become has \nactually made us more secure. We have people like Republican Senator \nMel Martinez and Republican Senator Chuck Hagel who recognize both in \nterms of the symbol of Guantanamo that has inflamed people around the \nworld, and that we have a situation now where people are dealt with in \nan indefinite situation, rather than moving forward, prosecuting people \nunder a courts-martial, if they in fact need to be prosecuted. We are \nnot opposed to that.\n  There are opportunities for providing a framework, which my \ncolleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff), outlined in \nterms of legislation that he has developed that we could use to move \nforward, deal with what needs to be dealt with, but do it in a way that \nis consistent with American values and American principles. And, in \nfact, if people detained thought that there was some end in sight \nrather than indefinite detainment, some experts argue we may actually \nget more cooperation.\n  There are alternatives. We can put people, for example, in \nLeavenworth. We ought to make clear that we are playing by our \nstandards, that we are going to play fair, and we are going to move \nforward.\n  I think it would be a very appropriate use of our Subcommittee on \nOversight and Investigations, which the gentleman from California (Mr. \nRohrabacher) chairs, to try to find out what the facts of the situation \nare; whether we are more or less at risk, and what lessons we learn \nfrom this sorry chapter in the past.\n  Our Republican friends have devoted 140 hours to investigating \nwhether or not the Clintons misused their Christmas card list, and \nthere were inquiries from committees trying to find out how they are \ndealing with letters that were sent to the Clintons' cat Socks.

We should send the \ntruth. Here is the truth, which dozens of Members know because they \nhave attended the open and classified briefings we have had on \nGuantanamo. We have spent as much time in the Committee on Armed \nServices over the last 3 or 4 weeks working on the security of people \nin Guantanamo as we have working on our own troops in the warfighting \ntheaters in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  Number one, there has not been a single death in Guantanamo. There is \nnot a Member who has argued against this amendment who can say at the \nsame time there has not been a single death in their own prison system \nin the State they come from.\n  Everybody in Guantanamo is allowed five prayer calls a day. That \nmeans we use our loudspeaker system to bring them to prayer call. We \ngive them 20 minutes of quiet time. We give them great meals. We give \nthem a medical system we have looked over very carefully, Democrats and \nRepublicans, which is considered to be as good as any HMO system in \nthis country, in which every detainee gets four checkups, on average, \nper month.\n  We have had over 24,000 interrogations in Guantanamo, and here are \nthe facts: People have talked about the use of dogs, the fact that dogs \nhave been present at Guantanamo at various times, especially with the \n20th hijacker, Mr. al Kahtani, who was subject to the most stressful \ntype of interrogation. There is not one recorded instance in any \ninvestigation of a dog biting a prisoner.\n  There are only a couple of recorded instances of a prisoner being \nstruck by a guard, and the one time when a guard struck a prisoner that \nhappened on General Hood's watch. That guard was struck by the \nprisoner, I believe he knocked a tooth out. The guard hit him with a \nhandheld radio. The guard, the American, was busted.\n  The watch word in Guantanamo is honor bound. The troops who guard \nthose people in Guantanamo, who are hijackers, who do include Osama bin \nLaden's bodyguards, who do include the 20th hijacker, the guy who was \ndestined to be on that plane that went into the ground in Pennsylvania, \nthe guy who was forced to listen to rock music, that is the torture \nthat the gentleman from New York was alleging to. The people who guard \nthose individuals who are dangerous are outstanding American soldiers \nwho are in fact honor bound.\n  I would put Guantanamo up against the prison system of any of the \ngentlemen who have spoken against this amendment from their own States. \nGuantanamo has a better record with fewer injuries, better record with \nno deaths, better medical treatment, and they have a better record for \nmethods of interrogation, which, incidentally, Republican and Democrat \nMembers have been allowed to watch over and over.\n  So the gentleman who could not understand why any hearings are being \nheld, I suggest you turn on C-SPAN and watch them.\n  I urge all Members to vote for this amendment.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I did not arrive at the decision to offer this \namendment lightly. I discussed it with former staffers and current \ninterns who have served recently in both civilian and military \ncapacities in Iraq. I discussed the situation with my husband, Dexter, \na decorated Vietnam veteran who was wounded in combat and awarded a \nPurple Heart. But it was my talks with my\n\n\nstepson Dougie, a first lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps, who is \nbeing deployed to Iraq in just 1 week, that had the most profound \neffect. He helped me to fully comprehend the importance of our mission \nin Iraq and the impact of what we say here and do here with the impact \nit has at home and on our Armed Forces serving abroad.\n  Mr. Chairman, our mission is just. It has far-reaching strategic and \npolitical ramifications. It is helping to further U.S. security and \nforeign policy goals throughout the region. For these reasons, and most \nimportantly for my stepson, Dougie Lehtinen, his financee, Lindsay \nNelson, who is also a Marine officer who will ship out to Iraq also in \na week, and to all of the members in our proud U.S. Armed Forces \nserving in Iraq, I am offering this amendment and I ask my colleagues \nto render their full support for it.\n  Iraq is one of the epicenters of the U.S. comprehensive strategy to \nfight terrorism worldwide. Our ability to project major armed forces to \nthe very heart of the Middle East provides the United States and our \nallies in the war against terrorism the wherewithal to directly address \nthe tactical and the ideological challenges of Islamic extremism.\n  Our presence in Iraq further strengthens our leverage against current \nand emerging threats and it increases the deterrent value of U.S. \npower.\n  Finally, through the promotion of incipient Iraqi democracy, we can \ncontinue our concerted efforts to counter root causes of Islamist \nextremist and terrorism in the region. The terrorists are fighting for \ntheir survival because freedom threatens them. Democratic governments \ndeny terrorists the weapons, the funds and sanctuary they need in order \nto survive. Democracy denies them new recruits.\n  Terrorism mastermind al-Zarqawi acknowledged that coalition forces \nwere having success and that Iraqi sovereignty and democratic \ngovernance would thwart their plans. In a February 17, 2004 letter to \nan al Qaeda operative, al-Zarqawi said, ``Our enemy is growing stronger \nday by day. By God, this is suffocation. We will be on the roads \nagain.''\n  One of Osama bin Laden's closest associates wrote in a book published \nin December 2003 that ``democracy is a far more dangerous threat,'' \nadding that it makes Muslims refuse to take part in jihad.\n  The continuing presence of U.S. and coalition forces must be \ndetermined by the achievements of concrete objectives, not by arbitrary \ndates on the calendar. Some may argue that my amendment sets the \nthreshold too high by stating that ``calls for an early withdrawal are \ncounterproductive to security aims of the United States and to the \nhopes of the Iraqi people.''\n  However, as we have repeatedly argued in this Chamber, words matter. \nWhat we say here to condemn human rights violations, incitement and \nanti-semitism or expressing support for pro-democracy advocates \nthroughout the world has a tremendous positive impact. In stark \ncontrast, incessant calls for an established date for withdrawal from \nIraq has a negative effect. They diminish the morale of the troops and \nserve to embolden the enemy.\n  Do we want to send a message to the terrorists that their war of \nattrition is succeeding, that their commitment to violence, to hatred, \nand to terror is greater than our commitment to a democratic Iraq, to \nspreading freedom and fighting tyranny?\n  The amendment before us seeks to restate our commitment to the \nsuccessful completion of our mission in Iraq. It establishes as U.S. \npolicy the pursuit of transfer of responsibility for security to Iraqi \nforces, but cautions against withdrawing prematurely, calling for \nwithdrawal to take place when U.S. national security and foreign policy \ngoals relating to Iraq have been or are about to be achieved. Is this \nasking too much?\n  Let us not waver on our commitment to our mission in Iraq. The Iraqi \npeople have not wavered. Our men and women in uniform are not wavering. \nIn fact, this weekend we saw newspaper stories reporting that soldiers \nare reenlisting at rates ahead of the Army's targets. Army officials \nsay this is due in part to a renewed sense of purpose in fighting \nterrorism.\n  Let us demonstrate to our forces that just as our Nation stood behind \nthe greatest generation during World War II as they fought against \ntyranny, so too do we stand behind our forces in Iraq, a new great \ngeneration of heroes whose actions will not only help to make the world \nsafer, but will alter the political landscape towards the irreversible \npath of freedom and democracy.\n  I ask my colleagues to support our troops. I ask my colleagues to \nsupport the Iraqi people. I ask my colleagues to fight the good fight \nfor freedom and for democracy. I ask my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I did not arrive at the decision to offer this \namendment lightly.\n  I arrived at this decision after listening to a former staffer of \nmine, who recently returned from Iraq, and one of my current interns \nwho served with the United States Army in Iraq.\n  I arrived at this decision after discussing the situation in Iraq \nwith my husband, Dexter, a decorated Vietnam veteran who was wounded in \ncombat and awarded a Purple Heart.\n  But it was my talks with my stepson Dougie, a first lieutenant in the \nU.S Marine Corps, that had the most profound effect on me and helped me \nfully comprehend the importance of the mission that our men and women \nin the armed forces are embarked on in Iraq.\n  My stepson, Dougie, is on his way to perform his duty in Iraq.\n  To him, it is not an obligation. It is an honor and a privilege to \nhave the opportunity to serve his Nation, to contribute to the freedom \nof the Iraqi people, to confront the terrorists, and, perhaps, most \nimportantly, to fight tyranny as the ``Greatest Generation'' did during \nWorld War II.\n  Our mission is just. It has far-reaching, long-term, strategic and \npolitical ramifications. It is helping to further U.S. security and \nforeign policy goals throughout the region.\n  For these reasons and, most importantly, for my stepson Doug \nLehtinen, his fiancee Lindsay Nelson, who is also a Marine officer who \nwill ship out to Iraq in a week, and all the members of the U.S. Armed \nForces serving in Iraq, I am offering this amendment and I ask my \ncolleagues to render their full support for it.\n  Simply stated, we cannot afford to yield a victory to the terrorists \nin Iraq and throughout the region.\n  Iraq is one of the epicenters of the U.S. comprehensive strategy to \ncombat terrorism worldwide--a strategy that includes: killing and \ndisrupting terrorists abroad, confronting theocratic and autocratic \nregimes that harbor terrorists and facilitate terrorist attacks, and \npromote economic reform and democracy as a means to address the \ngrievances of people throughout the region that have been manipulated \nand turned against us by the dictatorial regimes that permeate the \nregion.\n  Our ability to project major armed forces to the very heart of the \nMiddle East provides the United States and our allies in the war \nagainst terrorism, the wherewithal to directly address the tactical and \nideological challenge of Islamist extremism.\n  Our presence in Iraq further strengthens our leverage against current \nand emerging threats and increases the deterrent value of U.S. power.\n  Finally, through the promotion of an incipient Iraqi democracy, we \ncan continue our concerted effort to counter root causes of Islamist \nextremism and terrorism in the region.\n  The objective is for the U.S. to proactively engage and support \nreformers and assist in developing within the Middle East a bastion of \nstable, free-market democratic societies.\n  We are engaged in a struggle between moderation and extremism.\n  The terrorists are fighting for their survival. Freedom threatens the \nterrorists.\n  Terrorist mastermind al Zarqawi acknowledged that coalition forces \nwere having success and that Iraqi sovereignty and democratic \ngovernance would thwart their plans.\n  In this February 17, 2004 letter to al-Qaeda operatives, al Zarqawi \nsaid: ``Our enemy is growing stronger day after day . . . By God, this \nis suffocation! We will be on the roads again.''\n  He further said: ``we are racing time . . . If the government is \nsuccessful and takes control of the country, we just have to pack up \nand go somewhere else again, where we can raise the flag again or die . \n. .''\n  Democratic governments deny terrorists the funds, weapons, and \nsanctuary that they need to survive. Democracy and freedom deny \nrecruits.\n  One of Osama bin Laden's closest associates wrote in a book published \nin September 2003 that ``a far more dangerous threat'' is ``secularist \ndemocracy.''\n  He cautions against democracy's ``seduction'' as it drives Muslims to \n``refuse to take part in Jihad.''\n  This is a clear illustration of how our efforts in Iraq are serving \nour long-term goals of spreading democracy as an antidote to extremism \nand terrorism.\n\n\n  Success does not come without challenges. Creating new and effective \npolitical and security institutions in Iraq takes time.\n  The task before us is not insurmountable, but, if rushed, we do risk \nfailure for lack of persistence.\n  The continuing presence of U.S. and Coalition forces must be \ndetermined by the achievement of concrete objectives, not by arbitrary \ndates on the calendar.\n  The process of, and criteria governing, the withdrawal of U.S. and \nCoalition forces from Iraq must be performance-based, not \nchronologically-based.\n  Some may argue that my amendment sets the threshold too high by \nstating that ``calls for early withdrawal of United States and \ncoalition forces are counterproductive to security aims of the United \nStates and the hopes of the Iraqi people.''\n  I respectfully disagree. As we have repeatedly argued in this Chamber \nand in the International Relations Committee--words matter.\n  What we say in this Chamber through resolutions condemning human \nrights violations, for example, or condemning incitement and anti-\nSemitism, or expressing support for pro-democracy advocates throughout \nthe world, have a tremendous positive impact.\n  These statements and measures serve to empower those who toil for \nfreedom throughout the world.\n  In stark contrast, incessant calls for an established date for \nwithdrawal from Iraq have a negative effect. They serve to embolden the \nenemy and the terrorists.\n  Do we want to send a message to the terrorists that their war of \nattrition is succeeding? That we are weakening in our resolve?\n  That the terrorists' commitment to violence, hatred, and terror is \ngreater than our commitment to a democratic Iraq, to spreading freedom, \nand to combating the forces of evil and tyranny?\n  Many of our coalition allies in Iraq understand the importance of \ncompleting our mission there--allies such as Poland, the Czech \nRepublic, Romania, Albania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Georgia, Latvia, \nLithuania, Slovakia, and the Ukraine who understand the lessons of \nhistory and want to take steps to prevent any people from having to \nexperience the suffering that they endured under German occupation and \nSoviet communist rule.\n  My colleagues, this amendment does not question anyone's patriotism.\n  In fact, the amendment before you is a modified text which includes \nrecommendations from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  This amendment seeks to re-state our commitment to successful \ncompletion of our mission in Iraq.\n  It establishes as U.S. policy the pursuit of a transfer of \nresponsibility for Iraqi security to Iraqi forces, and cautions against \nwithdrawing prematurely, calling for withdrawal to take place when U.S. \nnational security and foreign policy goals relating to Iraq have been \nor are about to be achieved.\n  Is this asking too much--considering our goals are to combat those \nseeking to export their extremist, terrorist ideologies; those who seek \nto deny the Iraqi people their freedom; those who threaten global peace \nand security?\n  Let us not waiver on our commitment to our mission in Iraq.\n  The Iraqi people have not wavered.\n  Our men and women in uniform are not wavering.\n  In fact, this weekend saw newspaper stories reporting that ``soldiers \nare re-enlisting at rates ahead of the Army's targets.''\n  Army officials say that this is due, in part, to a ``renewed sense of \npurpose in fighting terrorism.''\n  Let us demonstrate to our forces that, just as our nation stood \nbehind the ``Greatest Generation'' during World War II as they fought \nthe evil pursuits of a tyrannical ruler, so too do we stand behind our \nforces in Iraq--a new great generation of heroes--whose actions in Iraq \nwill not only help make the world safer in the long-term, but will \nalter the political landscape toward the irreversible path of freedom \nand democracy.\n  I ask my colleagues to support our troops.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Iraqi people.\n  I ask my colleagues to fight the good fight for freedom and \ndemocracy.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 297, "speaker": "Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN", "itemno": 424}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000090", "text": "  Mr. LANTOS.

Announcing an early date of withdrawal \nbefore Iraqi forces are prepared to assume full responsibility for \ntheir country's security would allow the enemies of democracy and \nstability in Iraq simply to wait us out and to reverse all that our \ntroops have struggled and sacrificed for in Iraq.\n  We have committed ourselves to Iraq's freedom from the type of \nbarbarity that was inflicted upon it by Saddam Hussein and that would \nsurely be inflicted upon it again were the terrorists to win this war. \nOur mission in Iraq will be complete when Iraq is moderately stable and \nwhen its troops are capable of securing their own country.

But \nI think it is absolutely wrong for the country to set a timetable for \nan exit from Iraq. The timetable and our exit strategy should be the \nstanding up of the Iraqi forces so that they can protect this \ngovernment that they are putting in place through a representative \nsystem in which people are allowed to go to the polls, vote for their \nelected leaders, and have those leaders represent them until they \ndecide to vote again.\n  This idea of freedom, of democracy, which was embraced, I think, with \nunexpected exuberance by the Iraqi people, is something that we should \nbe very respectful of, and we should also be respectful of our great \nmen and women who right now have turned a major portion of their \npurpose, our uniformed personnel in Iraq, to the training up of the \nIraqi forces.

This amendment, quite frankly, would have Congress stick its \nhead in the sand and deny the reality that things need to change in \nIraq.\n  First, Mr. Chairman, the Republican leadership is continuing to \nstifle debate on the war in Iraq. Even worse, it is an effort to \nmarginalize and silence any critics of this administration's policies \nin Iraq. This is unacceptable and undemocratic. It is outrageous that \nthe Republican leadership has made in order only one amendment on Iraq. \nTwo of the four amendments dealt with Iraq, which I submitted to the \nCommittee on Rules. One amendment asked for the administration to \npresent just basically a plan for withdrawal and the other making it a \npolicy that the United States should not have permanent military bases \nin Iraq. Not surprisingly, the Republican leadership chose not to allow \ndebate on either of them. What in the world are they afraid of?\n  Secondly, Mr. Chairman, many of the fundamental assumptions in this \namendment are just plain wrong. This amendment would have us stay the \ncourse by ignoring the realities about the war in Iraq: realities like \nthe fact that we were misled into this war; realities like the fact \nthat there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq; realities like \nthe fact that the administration has no plans on how to end the war; \nrealities like the fact that our brave troops have become the rallying \npoint for the insurgency; realities like the fact that our occupation \nhas become a recruiting tool for foreign terrorists; and realities like \nthe fact that our Nation, our Nation, is less safe as a result of this \nwar.\n  An article in Sunday's Boston Globe reported on two studies of \nforeign fighters streaming into Iraq. The studies separately concluded \nthat a majority of the foreign fighters are not foreign terrorists, but \nhave become radicalized by the war itself.\n  And if this is not disturbing enough, yesterday's L.A. Times featured \na column that outlined potentially new partnerships starting up between \nthe leaders of Iraq and Iran. This emerging relationship has the \npotential to destabilize the Middle East and even to have our worst \nfears realized.\n  Mr. Chairman, reports like these are critical as to why this Congress \nshould have a free, fair, and honest debate on Iraq and we should have \nit now.", "turn": 304, "speaker": "Ms. LEE", "itemno": 431}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000435", "text": "  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN.

Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for \nyielding me this time, and I thank her for this important amendment.\n  Today, one way or another, we will be sending a very important \nmessage with this amendment. There are some here who will demand that \nthe U.S. set a deadline for withdrawal. In my view, that would be a \ndangerously bad idea.\n  For one thing, it would send a terrible message to our enemy. It \nwould tell our enemy that if they simply wait so long to a certain \ndate, the troops will wind down and they can take over once again. For \nanother, it sets an embittering message to our families who have lost \nloved ones. I am guessing that almost every Member here has attended \nthe funeral of a soldier lost in Iraq. I have. And I will never forget \nthe one that I went to when I met with the family before the service \nand I said, Is there anything I can do? and they said, Yes, do not back \ndown and tell the President not to back down because if you back down, \nour son will have died in vain.\n  But perhaps most importantly, forcing a withdrawal deadline sends a \ndangerous message to the Iraqi people. The enemy tells them day after \nday after day that Americans are going to cut and run. At the same time \nwe are telling them to come forward, to join us, to become trained, to \nbecome better educated, to get ready to help democracy stand up. But \nwhen we set a deadline for withdrawal, we play right into the hands of \nthe message of our enemy: Why should Iraqis come forward if they think \nthat we are going to pull out once again and pull out early? Those who \nsupport setting a deadline are pulling the rug out from democracy and \npulling a rug out from the Iraqis who might come forward.\n  Please, for the sake of our soldiers, their families, and the Iraqis \nwho are courageously battling bombs and bullets to rebuild their land, \ndo not set a deadline.\n  A previous speaker has said that this administration and this country \nhas no plan for getting out of Iraq.

The results of that \nare seen clearly in the fact that we have now lost more than 1,760 \nAmerican servicemen and -women killed, more than 35,000 seriously \nwounded.

Mr. Chairman, at a time when we should have an exit \nstrategy for our troops, this amendment provides Members of Congress \nwith an exit strategy for themselves, from responsibility for Iraq.\n  This amendment states that we should withdraw our troops from Iraq \nonly when the Iraqi forces are able to combat the insurgency and only \nwhen the government of Iraq is stable, at peace, and is not a threat to \nits neighbors.\n  We all know that we are light years away from both of these \nrequirements. This amendment will keep us in Iraq forever.\n  Furthermore, this amendment is essentially flawed because it fails to \naddress the correlation between the U.S. presence in Iraq and utter \nchaos and civil war-like state that country is in. The U.S. presence in \nIraq is fueling the insurgency and has turned Iraq into a training \nground for the insurgents. The insurgency is growing stronger by the \nday, and attack tactics are becoming more advanced. An article \npublished in New York Times on June 22 described how Iraqi rebels are \nrefining bomb skills and pushing the GI toll even higher. Improvised \nexplosive devices are now sufficiently sophisticated enough to destroy \narmored Humvees.\n\n\nThis means our soldiers are more vulnerable and casualty rates will go \nhigher than ever.\n  In May there were 700 attacks against American forces using \nimprovised explosive devices, the highest number since the invasion in \n2003. Furthermore, not only is the insurgency in Iraq becoming \nstronger, but according to a CIA assessment, the insurgency will also \nspread to other countries in the region.\n\n\n  Another article in the New York Times has described a new classified \nCIA assessment that the Iraqi war is likely to produce a dangerous \nlegacy by dispersing to other countries this conflict. According to the \nassessment, Iraq may even prove to be an even more effective training \nground for Islamic extremists than Afghanistan was in al Qaeda's early \ndays.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is time for us to face the facts about Iraq.

This amendment says that U.S. troops can only \nwithdraw ``when it is clear that the United States national security \nand foreign policy goals relating to a free and stable Iraq have been \nachieved.''\n  What is ``security at risk?'' Endlessly sending U.S. troops out on \npatrols where they become a mobile shooting gallery for terrorists \nmocks the word ``security.''\n\n\n  Because the administration's goals for Iraq include creation of an \nidyllic Western style democracy that is stable, saying U.S. troops are \nstuck there until that happens is the same as saying U.S. troops will \nhave to stay for 50 years or more.\n  Once the Iraqis have their constitution and an election, it will mean \nour troops have done everything that they can do and that it will be \ntime to bring them home. U.S. troops cannot impose a democracy in Iraq. \nThat is not their mission, it is not their job. Only the Iraqis can \ndevelop a democracy.\n  Finally, this amendment is pointless because it does not address the \nreal questions facing the United States in Iraq. When can the United \nStates begin to reduce the size of our forces in Iraq? We have already \nsaid we are leaving, so our departure is going to have to begin at some \npoint.\n  We have 140,000 troops in Iraq today. Do we need to keep that many \nthere until Iraq has been magically transformed into the peaceful, \nidyllic Western democracy that the authors of the resolution envision? \nI think not.\n  This amendment speaks of commitment to Iraq. I would humbly suggest \nthat 1,768 dead U.S. troops, 12,700 wounded U.S. troops, and $250 \nbillion represents plenty of commitment. How much more commitment is \nthis war worth?\n  As our military leaders in Iraq and senior administration officials \nhave said, the ultimate defeat of the insurgents in Iraq will not come \nabout through U.S. military action.\n  Instead, the mission we have given those commanders is to train the \nIraqis so they can assume the lead in the fight to defeat the \ninsurgents.\n  Why bring out American troops? Because by keeping our troops in Iraq \nindefinitely, we're asking them to resolve political and social issues \nthat need to be resolved by the Iraqis themselves.

Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me \ntime.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am 12 days back from a trip to Baghdad. Twelve days \nago I sat during a briefing with the State Department to assess what \nwas going on in that country. We were assured by the State Department \nrepresentatives that the drafting of the constitution, an integral part \nof setting up an Iraqi style government, an Iraqi style democracy, was \nongoing. At that time they had 15 Sunnis who had joined the \nnegotiations. Two of those Sunnis had since stepped down because of \nthreats to themselves and their families, but the Sunnis were having \ninput, which is important that they be in the deal.\n  The State Department folks are relatively confident, as confident as \nthey can be in this arena, that the August 15 date will be met, or \nshortly thereafter; that 60 days later a referendum vote will be held \non that constitution, and that the Iraqis for themselves will go to the \npolls one more time, as they did so courageously in January, to vote, \nsomething we take very much for granted many times.\n  Sixty days after that, in December, national elections will be held, \nand then the Iraqis will have a chance once again to exercise the \nfreedoms that we in America enjoy.\n  The violence between now and then will increase. In all expectations, \nthe insurgents see this as a last-gasp opportunity to derail the \ndemocratization of Iraq. It is unfortunate that that is going to \nhappen, but it is going to. The high profile, the high publicity \nevents, the murder of the Egyptian ambassador which occurred while we \nwere there, the callous, heartless murder of 24 young Iraqi children in \nan attempt to kill one American soldier, as regrettable as that \nsoldier's death was, those 24 lives were just as precious.\n  This violence will continue. We have to stand strong. We have to \nunderstand what their end game is. I support the amendment.

Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman, and rise today in \nopposition to the Ros-Lehtinen amendment because it essentially \nsupports prolonging the deployment of the United States military \npersonnel in Iraq.\n  Our troops deserve clear, concrete measures and milestones for \ndefeating the insurgency, for building up Iraqi\n\n\nsecurity forces. General Petraeus is doing a great job. Why can we not \nhave a timetable for how long it is going to take to get the 130,000 \nIraqi security forces trained and hand it over to the Iraqi people? I \nhave called repeatedly for the Department of Defense to do just that.\n  As a matter of fact, this Congress passed a supplemental \nappropriations bill that required the Department of Defense to report \nby July 11 the status of training the Iraqi forces. The Pentagon has \nrefused, or has not yet provided that information.\n  When is this Congress going to exercise its responsibility? Our \ntroops have done everything that we have asked of them in Iraq. They \nhave acted heroically. They have done their job. Now is the time for \nWashington to do its job and develop a strategy for successful \ncompletion of this mission.\n  I do not know where it came, that coming up with an exit strategy \nsomehow is something that is not in the United States' interest. I know \nwhen George Bush was Governor and we were in Kosovo, George Bush said, \n``Victory means exit strategy, and it is important for the President to \nexplain to us what that exit strategy is.''\n  Having an exit strategy and a strategy for success is just as \nimportant if not more important today in Iraq than it was in Kosovo. We \nhave made mistakes in Iraq. The Pentagon did not listen to General \nShinseki. We know that in Iraq the occupation is fueling the \ninsurgency.\n  We have a timetable in effect that was just articulated from the \ngentleman from Texas.

Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me \ntime.\n  I have made eight trips to Iraq since April 2003, and will be going \nagain this weekend. I have traveled with the military and I have also \ntraveled with nongovernment organizations outside the umbrella of the \nmilitary. I have literally talked with hundreds of Iraqi citizens, and \nI know their greatest fear.\n\n\n  Their greatest fear is, that we will leave. That is what they have \ntold me. They think we will leave them.\n  It is vitally important to the future of peace and prosperity in the \nMiddle East and, in fact, to the entire world that the United States \nmaintain its commitment, meet history's challenge, and assist that \nnation to stay on the course towards stability, democracy and economic \nvitality.\n  The United States has set many important benchmarks. We sought to \ntransfer power to an Iraqi government on June 28, 2004, and we did. We \nwanted to support the Iraqis in organizing a free and fair election \nand, on January 31, along with U.S. and international assistance, the \nIraqis held their landmark election, their first in 50 years. It was \nthrilling to witness. Women forced the men to come out and vote.\n  As we speak, all elements of Iraqi society, Shiites, Sunnis, and \nKurds are, working to draft a constitution and will hold a national \nreferendum on the document on October 15. And, in spite of the threats \nagainst them, they are persevering.\n  During our visits to Iraq, we observed our troops training the Iraqi \nsecurity forces, their police, their border patrol, their army. And as \nPresident Bush has said, as the Iraqis step up, Americans can step \ndown. That is the plan. Like the other goals we have committed to in \nIraq, we will stay our course.\n  Our withdrawal from Iraq will be made consistent with, as the \namendment states, our foreign policy and national security goals \nrelating to a free and stable Iraq and, thus, a free and stable world.\n  Mr. Chairman, Iraqis are making significant progress. I would like to \nread a short passage from an e-mail my niece just received from a \nsoldier who just returned after 15 months risking his life for Iraqis \nand for the national security of the United States. This is what he \nsaid: ``Despite what you might hear elsewhere,'' like in this chamber I \nmight add, ``the tide has turned in the Middle East and democracy is \ntaking hold. There is much work yet to be done,'' he continues, ``but \nwe should all be excited by the progress made so far. Just think about \nit! Government `of the people, by the people, for the people' has found \na foothold in, of all places, the Middle East!'' And, he continues, \n``Words are hard to come by to express my exuberant hope for the future \nof the Iraqi people and the rest of the Middle East.''\n  Mr. Chairman, I could not agree more with this soldier's sentiments.\n  As I witnessed Iraq's election, it is clear the only real losers are \nthe terrorists and insurgents trying to stop the march of democracy.\n  In defiance of the terrorists and insurgents, Iraqi men, women and \nchildren came out in droves.\n  There was a tangible sense of pride when the Iraqis dipped their \nindex finger in a well of ink and cast their vote.\n  One voter expressed gratitude to me when he said, ``Like you in the \nUnited States, I'm getting to choose my own leaders.''\n  We need to continue the process of supporting this nascent democracy \nand providing the new Iraqi government and its people with the \nphysical, financial and moral support to secure their nation and ensure \nliberty thrives.\n  I support the hard work of the International Relations Committee on \nthe underlying legislation and the gentlelady's amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to support its adoption.", "turn": 324, "speaker": "Mr. SHAYS", "itemno": 455}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000090", "text": "  Mr. LANTOS.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the Ros-\nLehtinen amendment. This amendment declares that Congress must not \n``withdraw prematurely the U.S. Armed Forces from Iraq.''\n  Prematurely? How many more Americans have to die or be wounded before \nwe recognize that bringing home our troops is not premature, but is \nactually long overdue?\n  Although I opposed this war from the very beginning, I also thought \nthat because of the chaos that we had caused that once we were there, \nwe needed to stay until Iraq was secure and the Iraqis' lives were back \ntogether. But I have come to realize that there can be no stability in \nIraq while our troops are still there. It is our very presence \nappearing as occupiers and the resentment it is breeding that is \nresponsible for the chaos and emboldened insurgency.\n  The Ros-Lehtinen amendment only serves to advance the Bush \nadministration's current failed policies by keeping the United States \nmilitary in Iraq indefinitely. This amendment would continue the \nunsuccessful military occupation. It would lay the groundwork for a \nconstant and unending war.\n  Only by ending the occupation can we hope to quell the violence and \ngive Iraq back to the Iraqis. We can secure Iraq by helping the Iraqi \npeople, not through our military, but through international \nhumanitarian efforts to rebuild their war torn economic and physical \ninfrastructure.\n  It is time for a new direction and fresh thinking on this subject, \nnot a continuation of the failed policies of the past 2 years. Instead \nof the same stagnant ideas repackaged, we need to end the military \noccupation of Iraq.

This is what it is all about.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  Americans are getting tired of this war. Mr. Chairman, we have been \nmisled and we have been lied to. We trusted the President, and when the \nPresident came to us after 9/11 and asked for the authority to find \nthose who had committed the attack on our country, we all voted for \nhim.\n  But since that time, the President did not go after the perpetrators; \nthe President did not go after Osama bin Laden. Instead, he went to \nIraq. They went to Iraq because they told us there were weapons of mass \ndestruction, and now we have discovered there were no weapons of mass \ndestruction. Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda is still out there operating, \nand we are still in Iraq.\n  Why are we there? The President came and told us, ``mission \naccomplished.'' And then we find that our soldiers are being attacked \nevery day. They are dying, over 1,760; over 15,000 maimed. They have \nlost their arms and legs and eyes.\n  Another lie. We were told that the soldiers had everything that they \nneeded, and then we find just yesterday in talking with one of the \nsoldiers returned from Iraq, he has been drinking filthy, dirty water; \ndid not even have clean water, did not even have bulletproof vests, and \nwe found that the Humvees did not have the armor.\n  They also told us they were going to get the proceeds from the oil \nthat they were going to pump and they were going to pay for rebuilding \nof the infrastructure. No, that is not happening. We are spending over \n$1 billion per week, and it goes on and on and on.\n  But, better yet, in this amendment they talk about not getting out \nuntil we train the Iraqi soldiers. How long and when? We were told they \nhad trained over 40,000. Guess what? I say to my colleagues, only 5,000 \nhave been trained and they do not have a plan for how to get it done. \nWe do not even have enough people that speak the language to be able to \ntrain the Iraqi soldiers. How long is this going to go on?\n  When people get up here and say they know that there is going to be \nmore violence, more people are going to be killed, whose children are \nwe talking about? Whose father are we talking about? Whose mother, \nwhose daughter are we talking about?

But I would submit to my colleagues \nthat that must be at a time that ensures that the baton of security is \npassed to a militarily capable, free, and democratic Iraq.\n  Let me point out to my colleagues that progress is being made in that \nregard. There are currently more than 171,000 trained and equipped \nIraqi security forces, including 76,000 soldiers, 63,400 police and \nhighway patrolmen, and 33,787 Ministry of Interior forces. So the \nprevious speaker, I do not know where she is getting her numbers, but \nthey certainly are not correct.\n  Iraqi security forces are now capable of planning and executing \noperations at the battalion level and higher, and there are a number of \ninstances where they have performed superbly.\n  One of the previous speakers, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. \nWoolsey), mentioned that we need to be providing money for rehab. We \nhave provided $19.1 billion to the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund. \nThat is a significant commitment. You cannot do reconstruction without \nsecurity.\n  Finally, I respectfully submit that any public announcement \nconcerning specific timetables or a date certain for withdrawal of our \nArmed Forces is likely to result in significantly advantaging the \nterrorists in a way that will put more lives, more American lives, more \nIraqi lives, at risk, and the mission itself will be put at risk.\n  I would also point out to my colleagues that the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Lee) did offer an amendment on the withdrawal issue; it \nfailed 33 to 12 in the committee.

Oh, I will vote for it, but if I were drafting it, I \nwould draft what I think is the correct issue before our country and \nbefore our military forces. I have a difficult time in understanding \nsome phraseology in the amendment that is before us which calls for an \n``early withdrawal,'' whatever that may be.\n  The issue is, when will we have the Iraqi security forces fully \ntrained to take over the important mission of security for their own \nNation? That is the issue before us.\n  On June 13, I sent a letter to the Secretary of Defense, Secretary \nRumsfeld, setting forward the fact that we need to speed up this \nprocess. We need to make sure that we do all we can and to get our \nallies, whether they be in the Arab nations adjoining Iraq, or whether \nthey be NATO nations, involved more and more in helping to train the \nIraqi security forces. General David Petraeus, one of America's \noutstanding military leaders of our day, has the mission of training \nthose Iraqi security forces and he is working very, very hard with the \ntraining forces that he has. He is a fine officer. He is a great \nleader. It is a mammoth task. But only this year, he has produced \nslightly over 5,000 fully trained Iraqi soldiers who can handle \nmissions on their own. This is totally inadequate.\n  We must do a better job speeding up this process, because one of two \nthings is going to happen if we do not speed it up. This is the issue \nbefore us. Number one, we are going to lose the American people. That, \nof course, would be disastrous for our effort in Iraq. Number two, we \nare going to put such a strain on the United States Army that some will \nterm it as broken.\n  Mr. Chairman, we are in a race against time. We are either going to \nlose the American people's support, or we are going to break the Army. \nThis month, the Army's recruiting numbers are far below its goal. It is \nan unmistakable trend. Although retention is holding, it is shaking the \nvery foundation of the American social structure. Army marriages have \nbroken up under the strain of unsustainable operations tempo, and the \ndivorce rate is increasing, signs of sure trouble ahead.\n  So we ought to be discussing how we speed up the process, how we urge \nour\n\n\nNATO partners to get involved in training. We understand that some 300 \nof those NATO partners will be coming in to help train, but we need \nmore than that.\n  That is the issue we should be debating at this moment, not using the \nphrase ``withdrawal,'' though I will support this amendment.", "turn": 334, "speaker": "Mr. SKELTON", "itemno": 465}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000435", "text": "  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN.

We left in Somalia, and it was a green \nlight to al Qaeda, because they said the United States is a paper \ntiger; we do not have the will to win a fight against the terrorist \norganizations and against the people who want to destroy our way of \nlife.\n  This is a life and death struggle.

The disastrous miscalculations and misleading \nestimates that surround this war have exacted a very high toll on the \nAmerican purse and our families. I cannot agree to any legislation that \ncalls for us to continue this course while Congress is denied critical \ninformation needed to evaluate our progress in Iraq.\n  The amendment before us calls for the transfer of responsibility to \nIraqi forces only when they are ready to assume such responsibility. \nHowever, it fails to address a plan for improving the training of Iraqi \nsoldiers that will enable them to take on that responsibility.\n  How will Iraqi forces ever assume responsibility if we fail to \nadequately train them?\n  Sadly, we have no real answers and no real strategy for shifting \nresponsibility and reducing U.S. involvement financially and \nmilitarily.\n  Congress has in good faith provided this administration with billions \nof dollars for military efforts in Iraq. This body has lived up to its \nend of the bargain and provided funding for our troops. But our \nquestions and concerns about our progress go unanswered.

Mr. Chairman, you know, in all contentious discussions, \nthere are a set of imaginary barricades, and people get on one side or \non the other. On one side of the barricades, the hypothetical \nbarricades, are people's main concern of prison welfare. They introduce \namendments, they focus their time and attention on the welfare of the \nprisoners.\n  On the other side of the barricade are people who focus on winning \nthe war, who focus on the beheadings that have happened to decent and \ngood people from the enemy. They focus on the assassinations, on the \ncar bombings, that indiscriminately kill elderly people and children. \nAnd so you have to decide what side of the barricade you are on.\n  Now, you can say that is a criticism of your patriotism. Not at all. \nNot at all. But you just have to listen to this debate to know the \noverriding concern of some is the welfare of the prisoners. Other \npeople want to win the war. Count me among the latter.\n  Another issue that I think is worthy of comment, we have heard a \ncouple of speakers from the other side, more than a couple, say this \ninformation is corrupt, falsification of intelligence, outright \ndeception by the administration.\n  I have, in my hand, ``Famous Last Words,'' a compendium of quotations \nfrom famous Democrats and famous people about the war that I think \nwould be worth recalling. The gentleman from California (Mr. Berman), \nmy good friend, said on October 10, 2002, ``Saddam, with a nuclear \nweapon, is too horrifying to contemplate, too terrifying to tolerate.''\n  The gentlewoman from California (Ms. Harman) of the Intelligence \nCommittee said this, October 9, 2002: ``The threat from Iraq is very \nreal, increasingly dangerous. Saddam's belligerent intentions and his \npossession and ongoing development of weapons of mass destruction to \nfulfill those intentions make him a clear present danger to the United \nStates and the world.''\n  Oh, you should read some of these.\n  Here is one from the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey): ``The \nthreat that we confront is Saddam Hussein. Saddam is in a category of \nhis own. No other head of state has been\n\n\nthe subject of an 11-year campaign to disarm and sanction him. He has \ninvaded two of his neighbors, assassinated 16 of his own family, tried \nto assassinate former President Bush, lied about his weapons buildup, \nfired missiles at Israel, and gassed his own people. The prospect that \nsuch a despot has biological and chemical weapons, anthrax, sarin gas, \nsmallpox and is nearing nuclear capability is a looming threat to \nmillions. We, as a Nation, have the responsibility to stop him.'' \nOctober 10, 2002 Congressional Record.\n  I have got quotes here from Madeleine Albright, Sandy Berger, \nPresident Clinton, all warning of nuclear weaponry, weapons of mass \ndestruction. Were they corrupt? Were they misleading? No, they were \nbasing their judgment on the best intelligence available, and they \nrelied on it and it turned out to be flawed.

I wish we had done that as the \ntime came for that war to be launched.\n  I believe it is appropriate to reinforce the fact that we are \nstanding here all as patriots who love this Nation and would defend \nher. But the Iraqi people deserve our debate today, and they deserve it \nbecause we need to know we can do better.\n  A limitation on transferring power, in fact, is something that we \nshould be concerned about. If we have a goal, a time certain, which \nmany of us believe is the appropriate way to go, you then can move the \nIraqi nationals and the Iraqi Armed Forces toward a goal. We will not \nhave the consternation of wondering whether the presence of the United \nStates military, even though we know terrorists exist, continue to \nagitate because of their presence, even though they are there to help.\n  It is important to realize that Members who want a time certain are \nno less patriotic, but they want to guide this process of a policy that \nseems to have gone awry. We want to save lives. We want to train Iraqi \nforces, but the tragedy of the explosion of a gas tank that killed \nalmost a hundred is something that is continuing that we want to see \nstopped.\n  And the American people want answers from the United States Congress. \nAnd so I think this debate is too short.

Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me \ntime. I really appreciate her bringing this very, very important \namendment to the floor.\n  As has been said earlier, this is a very important debate that we are \nhaving in the United States House of Representatives. Mr. Chairman, the \nestablishment of a firm deadline for withdrawal of American troops from \nIraq simply will put them in greater danger. It will embolden our \nterrorist enemies and all but assure the failure of that nation's \nfledgling democracy.\n  Under such a deadline, the best we could hope for is that our enemies \nwould simply go into hiding, wait for us to leave, then unleash bloody \nterror on their countrymen until Iraq's government fell, Iraq's people \nwere subdued, and Iraq's hope was destroyed.\n  In short, such a deadline would do nothing less than help our enemies \nwin the war. After so many have fought, and fought and sacrificed and \ndied, ending decades of Saddam Hussein's murderous tyranny, now with \nfreedom secured and stability in sight, with hope abounding in Iraq and \nacross the Middle East, to establish such a deadline, all but ensuring \ndisaster, would be morally and strategically indefensible. It would be \nan insult, an insult to every soldier who wears on their uniform the \nflag of the United States, a body blow to the cause of freedom and \njustice around the world, and a signal to evil men everywhere in the \nworld that America's spine had gone brittle.\n  A deadline for withdrawal would not amount to mere appeasement, but \nit would amount to surrender, betrayal, and it would amount to an \ninvitation for more bloodshed on our own soil. It cannot, cannot, \ncannot be done.\n  Failure in Iraq, which a premature withdrawal date would assure, \nwould be a crucial and possibly a decisive defeat in the global war on \nterror.\n  Rhetorical attempts to divorce Operation Iraqi Freedom from the \nbroader war on terror have failed in no small part because our enemies \nmake no small distinction.\n  Bin Laden, al-Sadr, Zarqawi, Fedayeen foot-soldiers, Hamas, \nHezbollah, Syrian imports, al Qaeda exports, Taliban holdovers, \nBa'athist henchmen, shoe bombers, dirty bombers, hijackers in Boston, \nroadside bombers in Baghdad, homicide bombers in Madrid, suicide \nbombers in London, and, yes, inmates in Guantanamo.\n  They are all the same. They are all the same, Mr. Chairman. They are \none enemy, terrorism, serving one cause, tyranny, against one target, \nfreedom.\n  Mr. Chairman, our soldiers in Iraq, Afghanistan and around the world \nare not fighting for a grotesque mistake. They are fighting for a noble \ncause. They are not Nazis or Soviets. They are heroes. The war in Iraq \nis not over. It is just not being fought on television. And our \ndecision to join the war on terror, which waged for years before 9/11, \nhas not made the war more dangerous but more hopeful for future peace.\n  Our enemies brook no confusion about their goal, it is to kill every \nlast one of us. The only thing standing between us and that fate is the \ncourage and determination and commitment of\n\n\nour soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines.\n  Members and political leaders from both parties would do well to \nremember that in times like these words have consequences. Consider the \nsoldiers now under enemy threat in Iraq. Consider the victims of 9/11 \nand their families. Consider the Iraqi people on January 30 raising \ntheir ink-dyed fingers, voting after holding their polling lines \nagainst the threat of terrorist attack. Consider the Iraqi women who no \nlonger fear the rape rooms, the Afghan men who can speak their minds \nfreely, and the children who can learn math and literature and history \noutside the control of their Orwellian regimes.\n  We are at war whether we like it or not, whether we fight it or not. \nOur enemies will keep coming. We cannot defeat them solely with our \nweapons, Mr. Chairman. We must defeat them with our will. Words and \ndeeds here at home and in particular here in Washington that embolden \nany of our enemies embolden all of them, and by doing so undermine our \ncause, weaken our resolve and threaten our troops.\n  Iraq is the war on terror. Victory in Iraq is a victory for hope. \nDefeat in Iraq is a victory for chaos and violence and evil. The \nterrorists know it, the Iraqis know it, and deep down even the most \npartisan critics of our Commander in Chief know it, too.\n  That is why we must stand and we must fight as we have for almost 4 \nyears here at home, in Afghanistan, Iraq and everywhere terrorism \nthreatens the survival and success of liberty until the fight is won.\n  We know not the day nor the hour, Mr. Chairman, when the scourge of \nterrorism will be repelled once and for all from Iraq, from the Middle \nEast, from our world, when citizens of all nations will breathe air \ncleared of the cries of wounded heroes and the report of hostile \ngunfire, when men will be free, when women will be honored, and when \nchildren will be safe.\n  As long as war is our policy and victory is our aim, Mr. Chairman, \nneither can our enemies.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to bring that day a bit closer by truly \nsupporting our troops in word as well as in deed by supporting the Ros-\nLehtinen amendment.", "turn": 349, "speaker": "Mr. DeLAY", "itemno": 480}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The Acting CHAIRMAN.

Mr. Chairman, I would like to commend the Chairman and \nRanking Member of the House Committee on International Relations for \ntheir work in drafting the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY \n06 and 07. Though I was supportive of the underlying bill that was \npassed out of Committee, I regret that I will not be able to vote in \nfavor of final passage due to the inclusion of a variety of amendments \nthat were added to the bill during floor consideration.\n  Additionally, I would have liked H.R. 2601 to address and correct the \nfailed U.S. policy towards Colombia. Current U.S. assistance to \nColombia is heavily weighted towards military and drug interdiction \nassistance, with only 20 percent of U.S. aid going to social and \neconomic programs like alternative development programs. I strongly \nbelieve that only through addressing the root causes of conflict in \nColombia, that of poverty and despair, will we be able to have lasting \npeace in Colombia.\n  I am very thankful though that the Chairman and Ranking Member for \nthe inclusion of a Sense of Congress that states that the U.S. foreign \nassistance should be used to support local capacity-building in \ndeveloping countries. I served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Colombia \nduring the 1960s, and the goal of our service was to ``work ourselves \nout of a job.'' By the end of our two year service as Peace Corps \nvolunteers, our goals were to have educated host country nationals in \ndifferent skills who could then take ownership of development projects \nand finish the job of developing their own country, in a culturally \nappropriate way.\n  As Peace Corps volunteers, I worked on micro development issues, and \nU.S. foreign policy, if it is to succeed in creating long-term \ndevelopment and foster stability in developing countries, should take \nthis mantra to heart, and focus on building local capacity. I am \ntherefore very thankful for the Chairman and Ranking Members \nrecognition of the importance of local capacity building by including \nthis important Sense of Congress in H.R. 2601.", "turn": 362, "speaker": "Mr. FARR", "itemno": 511}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "U000038", "text": "  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chairman, I rise in reluctant support of \nthis bill.\n  It is an important bill. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act \nauthorizes funding for 2 fiscal years for State Department programs, \ninternational broadcasting activities, international assistance \nprograms, and related agencies. The bill authorizes a 12 percent \nincrease in funding over fiscal year 2005, including funding increases \nfor peacekeeping missions, embassy security and relief for Africa.\n  H.R. 2601 also includes a number of amendments that were passed \nduring the bill's consideration on the floor. I voted against an \namendment offered by Representative Hyde regarding reform of the United \nNations. The amendment was based on the U.N. Reform Act, which I \nopposed--along with many of my colleagues--when it was considered as a \nstand-alone bill a month ago.\n  The U.N. is a critically important body that has taken on many of the \nworld's problems and solved them--problems such as poverty, disease, \nand international disputes. And the U.S. has benefited from U.N. \nactions. Just recently, the U.N. helped with elections in Afghanistan \nand Iraq and helped negotiate the withdrawal of Syrian forces from \nLebanon.\n  But I share the view that the United Nations needs to be improved so \nit can better carry out its indispensable role. It has serious \nproblems, as exemplified by the oil-for-food scandal and offenses \ncommitted by U.N. peacekeeping forces.\n  So, I support U.N. reform--but I could not support the approach the \namendment takes toward achieving that objective. It would require the \nSecretary of State to push for reforms at the U.N. in the areas of \nbudgeting, oversight and accountability, peacekeeping, and human \nrights. That is something that needs to be done. But if the Secretary \nof State cannot certify that the reforms have been achieved, starting \nin 2007, the Secretary would be required to withhold 50 percent of the \nU.S. assessed contributions to the U.N.'s regular budget. The assessed \nU.S. contributions are estimated at $362 million for 2005, and $439 \nmillion for 2006.\n  I think such a punitive and unilateral approach to reform will not \nwork. I think its primary result would be to further isolate the United \nStates while at the same time actually undermining ongoing efforts at \nreform and potentially jeopardizing the U.N.'s ability to focus on \nglobal threats and work toward greater global stability.\n  I also voted in reluctant support of an amendment offered by \nRepresentative Rohrabacher regarding detainees at Guantanamo.\n  I supported it because I believe it is important to support an \namendment that highlights the continuing threat of terrorism and the \ncontinuing necessity of disrupting terrorist activities and protecting \nthe security of the United States. But my support was reluctant because \nthe amendment inaccurately and incompletely characterizes the debate on \nthe detention facility at Guantanamo Bay and what goes on there.\n  It calls the capture, detention, and interrogation of international \nterrorists essential to the successful prosecution of the war on \nterrorism and the defense of the United States. Certainly no one can \ndisagree with this.\n  The amendment also states that the detention and lawful, humane \ninterrogation by the U.S. of detainees at Guantanamo is essential to \nthe defense of the United States and to the prosecution of the war on \nterrorism. It is similarly hard to disagree with this statement. But \nthe point is that detentions at Guantanamo haven't been consistently \nlawful or humane.\n  The amendment finally states that Guantanamo is so essential to the \ndefense of the United States that it should not be closed while the \nU.S. is waging the war on terrorism. That is an overstatement, in my \nopinion.\n\n\n  ``Gitmo'' is now infamous around the world as a place where detainees \nhave been mistreated and the Koran mishandled. There are over 500 \ndetainees remaining at Guantanamo--some who have been there for 3 years \nwithout being charged with a crime. We still don't know the extent of \nthe abuses since there hasn't been any independent commission appointed \nto look into all the allegations. But whether prisoner abuse is limited \nor widespread, there is a perception that bad things have happened at \nGuantanamo, and this perception only makes it easier for terrorists to \nfind willing recruits.\n  An independent commission could offer recommendations about what to \ndo with the remaining prisoners at Guantanamo as well as about the \nsituation at detention facilities all over the world. Closing \nGuantanamo may well be the best option, but it is an option we cannot \nconsider without also considering accompanying changes to the whole \ndetention system.\n  The Rohrabacher amendment didn't allow consideration of these finer \npoints, and my support for it should not be seen as endorsement of its \nlanguage.\n  I also reluctantly voted for an amendment offered by Representative \nRos-Lehtinen regarding our military activities in Iraq. The amendment \nstates that U.S. policy is to transfer responsibility for Iraqi \nsecurity to Iraqi forces and that the U.S. should only withdraw ``when \nit is clear that United States national security and foreign policy \ngoals relating to a free and stable Iraq have been or are about to be \nachieved.'' I agree.\n  In fact, most people agree on a policy of transferring responsibility \nfor security to Iraqi forces. But saying we will only withdraw when our \ngoals are met is problematic. That's because the administration's goals \nin Iraq are far from clear--the Defense Department shifts its focus on \na daily basis, and it has resisted requests to establish metrics or \nmeasurements to help us determine when these goals have been or ``are \nabout to be achieved.'' So given that we aren't sure of our goals, this \npart of the amendment is largely without meaning. It would have been \nbetter to include the language proposed in the motion to recommit, \nwhich I supported.\n  Recent calls for withdrawal have come about because there is rising \nopposition in this country to the administration's policy in Iraq. But \nI believe that just as rushing into Iraq was a mistake, rushing to get \nout would also be a mistake. We do need to send a signal to the Muslim \nworld that America has no desire to stay in Iraq, but we must also make \nclear the importance we place on transferring responsibility for \nsecurity to the Iraqis and on supporting efforts to assist the new \nIraqi Government draft a constitution.\n  This must not be our last word on Iraq. Though not unexpected, it is \ndisappointing that the Republicans continue to politicize our policy in \nIraq through cleverly drafted amendments and resolutions intended \nsolely to pigeonhole Members into black and white positions.\n  In conclusion, except for the parts related to the United Nations, \nthe bill is basically sound and deserves approval so that the \nlegislative process can go forward.", "turn": 363, "speaker": "Mr. UDALL of Colorado", "itemno": 512}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000810", "text": "  Mr. STARK. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2601, the \nForeign Relations Authorization Act. This bill endorses more of the \nsame disastrous foreign policy that the Bush Administration has \nrecklessly carried out since entering office.\n  Due to the addition of a misguided amendment on the floor today, this \nbill endorses the United States' continued involvement in the Iraq War. \nThis war has caused the death of almost 1,800 Americans and wounded or \nkilled more than 60,000 Iraqis, wasted billions of dollars, and created \na fertile breeding ground for anti-American terror. Instead of \nendorsing our prolonged involvement in a misguided war, this bill \nmisses a significant opportunity to focus on a plan to leave Iraq.\n  Further, it is disappointing that this Congress--for the second time \nthis year--has endorsed provisions that threaten punitive actions \nagainst the United Nations if they fail to implement the Republican \nCongress' idea of reform. It is this type of unilateral bullying that \nhas diminished the reputation and standing of the United States around \nthe world. Such uncompromising actions guarantee that the United States \ngovernment will alienate its friends and encourage its enemies. We \nbelong to a community of nations. We must begin to act like a good \nneighbor, or risk being further internationally isolated.\n  I also oppose this bill's claim that the Bush Administration policies \nat Guantanamo Bay, Cuba are humane and legal. After the revelation of \ninsurmountable evidence and court decisions, it is clear that the Bush \nAdministration fully supported the U.S. military's policy of torturing \nprisoners at Guantanamo Bay and has illegally held prisoners \nindefinitely without proper due process. To support any legislation \nthat contradicts these facts would simply be lying. I will not join the \nMajority in an attempt to blatantly deceive the American people and the \nworld.\n  This bill also continues to endorse providing military aid to Egypt \nand Israel. Only a fool would be surprised that lighting dynamite would \ncause it to explode. The same is true for providing more weapons to a \nvolatile and dangerous situation that exists in the Middle East. Our \nmilitary assistance has been employed to carry out violence against the \nPalestinian people and, in the case of Egypt, against their own \ncitizens. It is time that the Bush Administration got America out of \nthe arms dealing business and into the peace business. Only when the \nUnited States stops supplying the area with weapons will parties on \nboth sides view us as an honest broker. Only then will peace be \npossible.\n  Today, Congress had a real chance to advance an agenda that would \nsupport American international interests and provide humanitarian help \nto many countries in need. This bill fails to grasp that chance. A \nForeign Relations Act from the so-called greatest country on earth \nshould do more than promote an illegitimate war, supply arms to \nembattled nations and lie bold-faced to the world about activities so \nmany have witnessed. This bill is an embarrassment to this Nation and I \ncall on my colleagues to vote against it.", "turn": 364, "speaker": "Mr. STARK", "itemno": 513}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "F000010", "text": "  Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA.

Rangel International Affairs \nProgram at Howard University was included in the base text of H.R. 2601 \nand, again, I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for being fully \nsupportive of our efforts.\n  I am also appreciative that Chairman Hyde and Mr. Lantos agreed to \ninclude my request for authorization to fund an HIV/AIDS program at $1 \nmillion per year for fiscal year 2006 and $1 million for fiscal year \n2007 which is intended to be directed toward India. As we agreed, \nlanguage was included in the Committee report which states, ``The \nCommittee understands that India reports as many as 1,000 new AIDS \ncases per month, with some estimating that almost two-thirds of all \nHIV-positive Asians live in India. Many experts are particularly \nconcerned that infections are moving from high-risk groups to the \ngeneral population. The Committee believes that a significant program \nusing these funds should be directed toward India and strongly \nencourages the establishment of a summer exchange program for \npostgraduate students from India to attend conferences and engage in \nresearch activities at leading universities in the United States.''\n  I especially commend Mr. Sanjay Puri, who is a leading voice on India \nand India Americans, for his efforts and diligent work on this issue. I \nalso thank him for the work he has done to promote peace in the Asia \nPacific region. Included in the base text is language which requires \nthe State Department to report to Congress on the extent to which the \nGovernment of Pakistan has restored a fully functional democracy in \nwhich free, fair, and transparent elections are held. The Committee \nremains concerned that Pakistan's democratization process is moving too \nslowly and needs to accelerate considerably. Restoring democracy in \nPakistan is key to stabilizing the region and I thank the Committee for \nsupporting this important initiative.\n\n  At this time, I also wish to more extensively highlight the plight of \nthe West Papuans. First, I extend a warm welcome to the new Indonesian \nleader, President Yudhoyono, and I look forward to his fostering of \ndemocratic principles. I commend Australia for supporting the spread of \ndemocracy to Iraq and call upon the Australian Prime Minister, Mr. \nHoward, to seriously rethink the gravity of the situation and the \nimmediate and continuing threats to the people of West Papua. I urge \nthe Prime Minister to take the lead on engaging with the Indonesian \ngovernment on this issue. I also appeal to all countries which have \nthrown off the yoke of colonization and all Pacific nations to rise in \nsupport of the West Papuan cause.\n\n\n  There are three areas of serious deficiencies in Indonesia's \ntreatment of indigenous West Papuans which make an investigation \nabsolutely crucial. One is the Indonesian government's series of \nhostile actions in taking over West Papua. The Indonesian government \nenacted a takeover of West Papua by military force of arms in 1963 \nclearly violating the terms of an agreement mediated by the United \nStates and the Dutch in 1962 which gave sovereignty over West Papua to \na United Nations Temporary Executive Authority. In 1969 the Indonesian \ngovernment then orchestrated an election that many regarded as a brutal \nmilitary operation. Known as the ``Act of Free Choice,'' 1,022 Papuan \nelders were ``selected'' under heavy military surveillance and to no \none's surprise, every elder voted in favor of Indonesian rule.\n  Two, the Special Autonomy Law passed by the Indonesian Parliament in \n2001 supposedly enabled the people of West Papua to govern their own \naffairs. However, today key measures under the Law remain unimplemented \nor actively violated. West Papuans have not received their promised \nrepresentative body, funds vital for meeting their basic human needs \nare either unallocated, or are allocated late, transmigration of \nIndonesian migrants continues to overwhelm culturally distinct \nindigenous. West Papuans, and the division of West Papua into two \nprovinces violates key governance provisions.\n  Finally, human rights abuses committed by the military over decades, \nincluding those related to environment degradation, continue. Under the \nrepressive regimes of Presidents Sukrano and Schuarto, military \nbrutality resulted in the merciless killing or disappearance of an \nestimated 100,000 West Papuans while unofficial counts are set at the \nextraordinary level of 300,000 to 400,000. The Indonesian military and \nSpecial Forces have, in the past three years alone, murdered 81 \nindigenous civilians; tortured, beaten and jailed 34 West Papuans; \ndisplaced 6393 from their homes; and brunt down 23 churches and 370 \ntraditional houses. This violence threatens to escalate. The Indonesian \ncentral government is responding swiftly to a West Papuan announcement \nthat decisively rejects the Special Autonomy arrangements. It is \ncurrently transferring over 15,000 troops to West Papua, a region which \nis already occupied by six Army Battalions, one Air Force Battalion and \none Battalion of Mobile Brigade of Police, by far the heaviest military \npresence in all Indonesia.\n  These are human issues that transcend national borders. The \ninvestigation called for under this Bill will send a strong message \nthat Congress will no longer ignore the human rights abuses, the \nincreasing threat of military violence and the denial of a voice under \nwhich the people of West Papua have suffered for so many years. I thank \nthe Committee for including this historic initiative in the Foreign \nRelations Act. For too long, the cries of West Papuans have fallen on \ndeaf ears and I pray that with the concerted attention of the U.S. \nCongress, Australia, and the international community, justice and \nfreedom will finally come to the people of West Papua.", "turn": 365, "speaker": "Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA", "itemno": 514}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H001034", "text": "  Mr. HONDA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2601, \nlegislation to authorize appropriations for the Department of State for \nfiscal years 2006 and 2007. This bill appropriately recognizes the need \nfor the U.S. investment in international democracy and rule of law \nprograms, and it devotes needed resources to raising the standard of \nliving in the developing world.\n  As chair of the Congressional Ethiopia Caucus, I recently traveled to \nEthiopia to learn first-hand the economic, social and political \nchallenges that this developing nation faces. My visit to Ethiopia and \nmy analysis of the country's recent democratic elections reinforce my \nbelief that the State Department has an important and powerful role to \nplay in fostering democratic reforms and respect for human rights. I, \ntherefore, am pleased that H.R. 2601 increases funding for the State \nDepartment's Human Rights and Democracy Fund and the National Endowment \nfor Democracy. These two proven programs deserve our support, and if \nfunded at authorized levels, they will contribute to world peace. This \nforeign relations bill also authorizes funds for U.S. dues to \ninternational organizations and UN peacekeeping, including $1.3 billion \nto bolster peacekeeping over the next two fiscal years.\n  While I support H.R. 2601, I want to make clear my belief that it \ndoes not go as far as it should. H. Con. Res. 172, a resolution \nauthored by my colleague Congresswoman McCollum, provides a blueprint \nfor U.S. foreign assistance to developing nations. This resolution \ncalls on the President, the Secretary of State, and other executive \nbranch officials to provide the necessary resources to reduce poverty \nby advancing the promotion of democracy. As the world's remaining super \npower, we can afford to allocate 1 percent of the Federal budget to \ndeveloping nations, and we must do so. More funding must be \nappropriated to help alleviate the suffering of 1.3 billion people \nmired in extreme poverty and disease.\n  I am also disappointed by passage of the Hyde amendment, which will \nwithhold U.S. dues unless the international body adopts a specified \nlist of reforms. Based on the United Nations Reform Act, the Hyde \nAmendment also requires the U.S. to veto new or expanded peacekeeping \nmissions if the reforms are not implemented. I do believe reforms are \nnecessary, and base text of H.R. 2601 provides for the necessary \nreforms. The Hyde Amendment, however, requires unreasonable reforms and \nsets punitive action that is counterproductive. I join the Ranking \nMember Lantos in opposing this amendment, and I will work in conference \nto eliminate its provisions from the conference report.\n  Mr. Chairman, the funding authorized under this bill is only one, \nsmall step in the global effort to end the hunger and malnutrition \nfaced by over 800 million children around the world on a daily basis. \nAs the world's wealthiest nation, we have a moral obligation to be the \nleading advocate for and contributor to developing nations. I urge my \ncolleagues to pass this bill.", "turn": 366, "speaker": "Mr. HONDA", "itemno": 515}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "P000583", "text": "  Mr. PAUL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this foreign \nrelations authorization bill. Something has gone terribly wrong with \nour foreign policy when we feel we must take almost 21 billion dollars \nout of the pockets of the American taxpayer and ship it overseas. \nImagine what the Founders of this country would say if they were among \nus to see this blatant disregard for the Constitution and for the \nfounding principles of this country. This bill proceeds from the view \nthat with enough money we can buy friends and influence foreign \ngovernments. But as history shows us we cannot. The trillions of \ndollars we have shipped over seas as aid, and to influence and \nmanipulate political affairs in sovereign countries, has not made life \nbetter for American citizens. It has made them much poorer without much \nto show for it, however.\n  Now we have a Republican-controlled Congress and White House, and \nforeign spending soars. It was not that long ago when conservatives \nlooked at such cavalier handling of U.S. tax dollars with \nconsternation. Now it seems that they are in a race with the Left to \nsee who can spend more.\n  What is wrong with this bill? Let me just mention a few of the most \negregious items. In the name of promoting ``religious liberty'' and \n``fighting anti-Semitism'' this bill will funnel millions of dollars to \nthe corrupt Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) \nand its Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR). \nThis unaccountable international organization is at the forefront of \nthe manipulation and meddling in the internal affairs of other \nsovereign states, and has repeatedly dishonored itself through \npolitically-biased monitoring of foreign elections. The OSCE does not \ndeserve a penny from the American taxpayer, but this bill will make \nsure that the lavishly paid bureaucrats that staff the organization \nwill be able to maintain their standard of living--at our expense. With \nregard to religious liberty, privately funded voluntary organizations \nhave been shown to be much more effective in promoting tolerance. This \nis mainly true because these are true grassroots organizations with a \nstake in their countries and communities, rather than unelectd \ninternational bureaucrats imposing politically-correct edicts from \nabove.\n  This bill spends a total of four and a half billion dollars on \nvarious United Nations activities, UN peacekeeping, and U.S. ``dues'' \nto various international organizations. Forcing the taxpayer to \ncontinue to underwrite these organizations, which do not operate in our \nbest interests, is unconscionable.\n  This bill continues to fund organizations such as the National \nEndowment for Democracy, which as I have written before has very little \nto do with democracy. It is an organization that uses U.S. tax money to \nactually subvert democracy, by showering funding on favored political \nparties or movements overseas. It underwrites color-coded ``people's \nrevolutions'' overseas that look more like pages out of Lenin's \nwritings on stealing power than genuine indigenous democratic \nmovements. The NED used American taxpayer dollars to attempt to \nguarantee that certain candidates overseas are winners and others are \nlosers in the electoral processes overseas. What kind of message do we \nthink this sends to foreign states? The National Endowment or Democracy \nshould receive no funding at all, but this bill continues to funnel \ntens of millions of dollars to that unaccountable organization.\n  I am also very concerned about several of the amendments to this \nlegislation. First, the extremely misleading UN ``reform'' act was \nslipped into this bill even though it was already passed on the Floor \nas a separate bill. As I have written about this terrible legislation, \n``it will give the United Nations unprecedented new authority to \nintervene in sovereign states.''\n  Another amendment will create a chilling ``Active Response Corps,'' \nto be made up of U.S. government bureaucrats and members of\n\n\n``non-governmental organizations.'' Its purpose will be to \n``stabilize'' countries undergoing ``democratic transition.'' This \nmeans that as soon as the NED-funded ``people's revolutionaries'' are \nable to seize power in the streets, U.S. funded teams will be deployed \nto make sure they retain power. All in the name of democracy, of \ncourse.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is a shameful day for the U.S. Congress. We are \ntaking billions out of the pockets of Americans and sending the money \noverseas in violation of the Constitution. These are billions that will \nnot be available for investment inside the United States: investment in \ninfrastructure, roads, new businesses, education. These are billions \nthat will not be available to American families, to take care of their \nchildren or senior relatives, or to give to their churches or favorite \ncharities. We must not continue to spend money like there is no \ntomorrow. We are going broke, and bills like this are like a lead foot \non the accelerator toward bankruptcy.", "turn": 367, "speaker": "Mr. PAUL", "itemno": 516}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000487", "text": "  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2601. The \nchairman, Ranking Member, and Committee members have worked well to \ngive our State Department the tools necessary to carry out our Nations' \nforeign policy in a very challenging world.\n  As Chairman of the Subcommittee on International Terrorism and \nNonproliferation, I'd like to bring attention to two important \nprovisions in this bill.\n  Importantly, this bill offers support to the Trans-Sahara Counter \nTerrorism Initiative, a comprehensive counter-terrorism program in \nnorth Africa. Its predecessor, the Pan-Sahel Initiative, has worked to \nboost the anti-terrorist capabilities of Mauritania, Mali, Niger and \nChad--producing promising results with modest resources. The effort to \nexpand the PSI into the TSCTI, so that countries across the Sahara are \nable to bolster their ability to deny terrorist sanctuaries, is a much-\nneeded development. Transnational terrorists, linked to al-Qaeda, have \nbeen found operating in this vast, and largely ungoverned portion of \nthe world. The United States must respond to Africa's growing strategic \nimportance. This program, when fully implemented, will be an important \nstep in that direction.\n  Additionally, the bill updates the existing legislation requiring \nthat the State Department annually report to Congress on Patterns of \nGlobal Terrorism. For the past 2 years, this key report has been mired \nin controversy. The 2003 edition errored in underreporting attacks. The \n2004 report was issued minus its traditional annex statistically \nreporting on the number of terrorist attacks worldwide.\n  This legislation, which builds upon a hearing held by the \nSubcommittee on International Terrorism and Nonproliferation, seeks to \naddress those controversies and improve Patterns by requiring a single \nauthoritative report and updating the criteria to be used in cataloging \nterrorist attacks. For instance, in 2004--under the old criteria--a \nRussian airliner downed by Chechen terrorists was not recorded, as it \nwas deemed to not involve citizens of more than one country. Yet, a \nsecond Russian airliner, which was taken out of the sky simultaneously \nby Chechen terrorists, was counted--as one passenger was a foreign \nnational. With this legislation, such parsing should be eliminated--and \nterrorism will be counted as terrorism--so that we can get full grasp \nof the challenges facing us. The legislation also requires the \nSecretary of State to appear before Congress to present the annual \nPatterns of Global Terrorism report. The threat to the United States, \nour allies and interests from transnational terrorism will require \nevery element of national power to combat it. Congress has a key role \nto play in this regard.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.", "turn": 368, "speaker": "Mr. ROYCE", "itemno": 517}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The Acting CHAIRMAN.

Mr. Speaker, let me be clear from the very beginning. \nDemocrats are strong supporters of our Nation's Armed Forces, of the \nmen and women, the sons and daughters, who defend our freedom and \nprotect our interests while in harm's way. Therefore, as Members of \nCongress, it is our duty, our moral obligation and our responsibility \nto the American people and to those very troops to ensure that our \ncountry has a success strategy for Iraq so that we can eventually bring \nour troops home. However, I am not referring to a hard and fast \ntimetable or date certain that our troops have to be withdrawn by.\n  But, unfortunately, the bill we have before us today, as amended, \nfails the American people because it does not clearly define the \nbenchmarks for that success strategy. Unless we adopt this motion to \nrecommit, we have no defined goals, no defined measurable standards, \nand no strategy for success in Iraq.\n\n\n  Without a clearly defined strategy for success in Iraq, this \nadministration has no accountability to the Congress, our troops in \nIraq, their families here at home, or the American people. Right now, \nthis bill does not define what the American and Iraqi people should \nexpect from our engagement in Iraq. If you do not know where you are \ngoing, how can you possibly know when you will get there?\n  This administration possesses the information, the means and the \nwherewithal to produce a defined plan for success in Iraq, and has \nfailed to do so. They should come not only to Congress, but also to the \nAmerican people and lay out their benchmarks so we know exactly what we \nneed to do to achieve success in Iraq.\n  Up to this point, Congress has abdicated its responsibility on Iraq. \nThe Republican leadership has provided the administration with a blank \ncheck when it comes to Iraq. And with over 1,760 American soldiers \ndead, more than 13,500 others wounded, many of them severely, and over \n$200 billion appropriated, that simply cannot continue.\n  It is also important that the Iraqis understand our goals and what \nbenchmarks we will use to determine the fulfillment of those goals. By \nestablishing easily understandable benchmarks, which include creating a \nfunctioning Iraqi security force, the writing of a constitution, \nholding free and fair elections, we let the Iraqi people know that we \nare not occupiers. By establishing such standards, we show the Iraqi \npeople that we have no plans to permanently remain in Iraq and, in \ndoing so, possibly diminish support for the insurgency. Without these \nbenchmarks, many will question what our purpose is in Iraq and how long \nwe will be there.\n  Clearly, our current policy could hardly be called a success. Iraq \nhas become not only ground zero for terrorism, but also the breeding \nand training ground for those that can and very well may seek to carry \nout future terrorist attacks throughout the world.\n  That is why we must have clearly defined benchmarks that are detailed \nand specific. These benchmarks must be in distinct areas such as \nsecurity and troop levels and Iraqi governance and democracy, because \nright now we are unsure of how this administration would define \nsuccess.\n  Republicans advocate for established standards and tests to measure \nsuccess in education. They expect this of our children. Well, why \nshould we not expect the same type of measurable standards from the \nadministration when it comes to Iraq?\n  The administration refuses to define success. Tell us what it looks \nlike, because there is no way in that form in which we will know when \nwe have achieved it.\n  Are we talking about the quantity of Iraqi troops? Do we know the \ntrue number of Iraqi troops and security forces that will be needed to \nprovide security for the entire nation of Iraq? Is it 160,000? Is it \n300,000? Are we talking about the quality of Iraqi troops? Do we know \nhow many battalions of Iraqi troops are currently able to fight without \nthe direct support of American forces? It has been reported that only \nthree Iraqi battalions are fully operational, meaning that over 100 \nbattalions cannot handle the job of providing security for Iraq.\n  Does democracy simply mean holding elections, or does democracy mean \nholding free and fair elections based on a fully functioning \nconstitution? We are not quibbling over details here. These critical \nquestions go to the core issues that will determine success in Iraq.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the motion to recommit so that we can \nhave a clear and well-defined strategy for success in Iraq. Without a \nplan for success, we are doomed to failure. The administration is \nkeeping us in an open-ended engagement with no clear end in sight.\n  As we ask the sons and daughters of America to stand in harm's way, \nwe must ensure that they are doing so no longer than it is necessary to \nensure success.
