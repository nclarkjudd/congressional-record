{"content": [{"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000146", "text": "  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I rise to honor one of the pillars of \nmy hometown, Searchlight, NV--Mrs. Verlie Doing. Saturday, July 23, \n2005 will be designated Verlie Doing Day, and it could not go to a more \ndeserving or influential person.\n  Searchlight has never been the same since Verlie came to town in 1968 \nto help her late husband run Sandy's Casino. They built the Searchlight \nNugget, which Verlie still owns. Verlie is a proud Texan, but she \nquickly adopted the citizens of Searchlight and put down lasting roots \nin the community that will benefit many generations to come.\n  For years, Searchlight did not have a senior center; so Verlie \ndonated a building for the Searchlight Senior Citizen's Center. \nSearchlight did not have a church, so Verlie helped found the \nSearchlight Community Church, where she plays the organ every Sunday. \nSearchlight did not have a modern\n\n\npark so Verlie established Searchlight Park, equipped with a new \nplayground, grills, and picnic areas for the town.\n  These are a few of many visible contributions that Verlie made to the \ncommunity, but Verlie's most important contributions exist outside of \nthe public eye. She never asks for recognition and she does not draw \nattention to her actions, but her charity touches every person in need.\n  ``She's always doing something for someone,'' said long time friend \nMarion Young. ``Verlie has a kindness for everyone and she'll never let \nsomeone go down the road hungry.''\n  Much of Verlie's philanthropy occurs behind the scenes, but her \nimpact is felt throughout Searchlight. Each year, Verlie furnishes ice \ncream for ice cream socials. She has always supported the local police \ndepartment, allowing the Searchlight Police to have Police Officer's \nNight Out. Verlie also provides a steak dinner annually for our \nfirefighters and medical workers. Local children at the elementary \nschool are treated to hamburgers at the Nugget for good grades. Anyone \nin need always comes to Verlie first, and she never turns them away.\n  Verlie means a lot to me personally. After my father's passing, \nVerlie was a close friend to my mother. She would take her to Las Vegas \nto shop, and looked after her because my mother lived in Searchlight \nalone. Her thoughtfulness and compassion helped my mother make it \nthrough tough and trying times. I will never be able to repay her \nkindness to my mother.\n  Verlie understands the importance of community. Her philanthropy--\nboth visible and invisible--has made Searchlight the town it is today. \nVerlie Doing has touched every life in Searchlight, including my own, \nand I know that she has changed each life for the better.\n  Congratulations, Verlie. I am proud to honor an authentic Searchlight \nhero.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. REID", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "S8545-S8546", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "VERLIE DOING", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgS8545-2", "title": "VERLIE DOING"}
