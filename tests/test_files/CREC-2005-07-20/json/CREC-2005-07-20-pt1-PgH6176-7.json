Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the Turkish \noccupation of Cyprus, a shameful occupation that is now entering its \n31st year. Let me begin by thanking the gentleman from Florida (Mr. \nBilirakis) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney) for \nproviding an opportunity for discussion on this important topic.\n  Mr. Speaker, Turkish troops have been in Cyprus since the occupation \nin 1974, when over the course of a two-stage offensive, Turkish troops \ntook control of 38 percent of the island. The number of occupying \ntroops now stands at over 30,000 Turkish troops, making Cyprus one of \nthe most militarized countries in the world.\n  As a Cuban political refugee, the values of liberty and democracy are \nvery dear to my heart. I personally empathize with the Greek Cypriot \ncommunity and share their plight to achieve a fair end to the Turkish \noccupation.\n  The emergence of a strong, vibrant and justifiably unified Cyprus \nwould promote stability both politically and economically to the entire \nMediterranean region and would provide a strategic ally for the United \nStates at the crossroads of Europe, Africa, and Asia. As a senior \nmember of the House Committee on International Relations and as a \nmember of the Congressional Caucus on Hellenic Issues, I shared the joy \nwith families across Cyprus for their much-deserving union with the \nEuropean Community, as the prominence of Cyprus will be augmented by \nits full integration into the European Union.\n  Although all of us wanted to see a fair end to the division of Cyprus \nbefore its accession to the EU, the Annan\n\n\nPlan for a Cyprus settlement was rightfully voted down by the Greek \nCypriots by a large majority of 76 percent. The plan imposed \nunacceptable conditions, including enabling Turkish troops to remain in \nCyprus for an indefinite time, even after Turkey's eventual accession \nto the European Union. There can be no reunification plan that permits \nTurkish troops to remain stationed on Cypriot soil.\n  Likewise, the plan unfairly allowed Turkish Cypriots and mainland \nTurkish settlers to keep Cypriot homes and other properties they seized \nfollowing the Turkish invasion of Cyprus and it would not have to \nreimburse the owners of the property. There can be no unification that \nprovides for the expropriation of Cypriot property.\n  In March of this year, I wrote to President Bush demonstrating that \nthe ``no vote'' must not be interpreted at a vote against \nreunification, but rather as a legitimate expression of the real \nconcerns that made that particular version of the Annan Plan \nunacceptable to Greek Cypriot voters.\n  The United States, Cyprus, and Greece continue to maintain a close \nrelationship, and have a great deal in common. Indeed, the democratic \nprinciples which unite our nations were first planted some 2,500 years \nago in ancient Greece.\n\n\n  The very word ``democracy'' is a construct of two Greek words, \n``demos'' and ``kratos'' meaning ``rule by the people,'' and its \nprinciples were discussed by the Founding Fathers and are evident in \nour own Constitution.\n  James Madison, a crafter of this great Nation, wrote the following: \n``Among the confederacies of antiquity, the most considerable was that \nof the Grecian republics.''\n  Who are we to argue with James Madison?\n  Today, Cyprus, Greece and the United States share a deep and abiding \ncommitment to democracy, human rights, free markets and the ideal and \npractice of equal justice under the law.\n  As one of our strongest allies in the war against terror, Greece and \nthe Republic of Cyprus continue to fight against the latest global \nthreats of terrorism and state-sponsored terrorism, nuclear \nproliferation, illegal narcotics and international crime. Cyprus has \ntaken many concrete and active steps to target the perpetrators, \ncollaborators and financiers of terrorism.\n  As a NATO ally, the Greek government has given the United States both \nmilitary and financial support for Operation Enduring Freedom, \nincluding unrestricted use of its air space and humanitarian assistance \nto Afghanistan.\n  Most recently, Greece and the United States successfully collaborated \nduring the Summer Olympic Games to guarantee the safety and success of \nthese events. In testament to their commitment to human welfare, \nGreece's security budget was $1.2 billion, an amount exceeding all \nprior Olympic games. In recognition of our commonalities, I urge \nCongress to remain engaged in the search for a just and lasting \nreunification of Cyprus that will promote peace and stability in this \nimportant region.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6176-H6177", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "31ST ANNIVERSARY OF ILLEGAL TURKISH INVASION AND OCCUPATION OF CYPRUS", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6176-7", "title": null}
