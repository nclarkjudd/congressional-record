Mr. Speaker, I heard the remarks of the majority leader a \nfew minutes ago. Democracy depends on free speech and dissent. Free \nspeech is stifled when dissent is labeled treason or is derided in time \nof war as not supporting our troops.\n  We all support our troops. One can point out the mistakes or the \ndishonesty of the administration while not stinting in supporting our \ntroops. Pointing out that the administration misled the country about \nweapons of mass destruction in Iraq is not ``not supporting our \ntroops.''\n  Pointing out that Karl Rove appears to have participated in a \nconspiracy to punish Ambassador Wilson for telling the truth about this \nby revealing the Ambassador's wife's CIA role is not ``not supporting \nour troops.''\n  Pointing out the administration's justification for keeping our \ntroops in harm's way in Iraq flip-flops by the season is not ``not \nsupporting our troops.''\n  Demanding proper investigation of evidence that the administration \nhas disgraced this country by evading our laws against torturing \nprisoners is not ``not supporting our troops.''\n  A free society requires that all these accusations see the light of \nday. Let the administration rebut them if they can. But do not use the \nmantra of supporting our troops to stifle essential free speech.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. NADLER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6112", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "DEMOCRACY DEPENDS ON FREE SPEECH AND DISSENT", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6112-4", "title": "DEMOCRACY DEPENDS ON FREE SPEECH AND DISSENT"}
