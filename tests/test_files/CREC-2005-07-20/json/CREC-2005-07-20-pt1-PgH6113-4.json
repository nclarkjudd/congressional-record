Mr. Speaker, over the last few days I had the \nprivilege of visiting in the home of John Bocerri. John Bocerri is a \nyoung Ohio State representative. He is the husband of Stacy, the father \nof two young daughters and just 3 days ago brought to his home from the \nhospital his third child, born 8 pounds, 8 ounces, young Matthew \nBocerri.\n  I was in that home as John gave that young infant into the arms of \nhis young daughters for the very first time. John is a pilot in the Air \nReserves flying out of the Youngstown Air Base. He flies the large C-\n130 transport planes.\n  On Thursday of this week, tomorrow morning, at 10 o'clock, John \nBocerri leaves his wife, leaves his two daughters and his new infant \nson to go to Iraq for the fourth time. For the fourth time. John \nBocerri represents the hundreds, yea, the thousands of young Americans \nwho are serving this country with honor and distinction. It is sad that \nJohn Bocerri's children will pay for the cost of this war.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. STRICKLAND", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6113", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "SERVICE IN IRAQ", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6113-4", "title": "SERVICE IN IRAQ"}
