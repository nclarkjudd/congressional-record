Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in support of the United \nStates-Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement and the \nbenefits it will provide to hard working farmers in Indiana and all \nacross this country.\n  Currently, the U.S. market is already fairly open to agricultural \nproducts from Central America and the Dominican Republic, but U.S. \nfarmers face a variety of tariffs and other barriers when exporting to \nDR-CAFTA countries. This agreement will eliminate these barriers, \nreciprocate open market access, and put American farmers on a level \nplaying field.\n  More than half of America's agricultural exports will receive \nimmediate duty-free access to DR-CAFTA countries under this agreement. \nThis agreement will provide U.S. farmers with unequaled access to a \nlarge market with growing incomes and a growing demand for agricultural \nand food products.\n  Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support American \nfarmers and support this very important piece of legislation.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CHOCOLA", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6174", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "OPEN MARKET ACCESS WITH CAFTA", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6174-4", "title": "OPEN MARKET ACCESS WITH CAFTA"}
