Mr. President, I rise today to honor the \nachievements of the California Association of Sanitation Agencies, and \nto celebrate the organization's 50th anniversary.\n  CASA has provided the State of California with clean, safe, and \nreliable drinking water since its founding in 1955. Not only has CASA \nworked hard to ensure the well-being of Californians, but it has also \nchampioned a multitude of environmental issues related to clean water \nand water infrastructure that have been vital to California's long-term \neconomic and social stability.\n  I want to recognize CASA's proactive leadership in promoting \npartnerships with a variety of organizations to create a sound public \nhealth and environmental agenda. For the past 50 years CASA has been \nthe voice of the public wastewater agencies and served to assist and \nmonitor a variety of water quality, and related policy issues.\n  CASA has fought hard on behalf of California's sanitation agencies \nand played an active role in numerous legislative struggles. Among \nCASA's legislative achievements include sponsoring legislation that \ngives publicly owned treatment works the authority to levy civil and \nadministrative penalties against industrial dischargers for violations \nof local wastewater ordinances. Additionally, CASA has worked in \npartnership with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to develop \nand implement effective water rules for air toxics, sewer overflows, \nand biosolids management.\n  CASA has acted as a valuable resource by helping its member agencies \nunderstand and comply with varying\n\n\nFederal and State water quality standards. CASA also has provided the \nlegal, legislative, and administrative support for the publicly owned \ntreatment work community and helped set the precedent for ensuring \nclean and safe water for all Californians. Over the years, I have come \nto value CASA's insight and suggestions for improving our Nation's \nwater quality.\n  Today I celebrate 50 years of CASA's devoted service and \ncontributions to our Nation, and call upon CASA to continue to lead the \nway in its innovative and cooperative stewardship of our Nation's \ncomplex and growing waterways. Water quality is imperative to the \ndevelopment and welfare of my State and the Nation, and I thank CASA \nfor its continued effort and contributions to the cause.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mrs. FEINSTEIN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "S8548-S8549", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgS8548-2", "title": "ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS"}
