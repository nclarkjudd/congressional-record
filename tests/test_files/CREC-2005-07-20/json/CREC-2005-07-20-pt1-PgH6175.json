Mr. Speaker, it has struck me as I have \nlistened to the debate here that there are many myths propagated about \nCAFTA, the proposed free trade agreement between the Dominican \nRepublic, Central American nations and the United States.\n  One is that we are somehow dropping all of our tariffs across the \nboard. With very few exceptions, the products which CAFTA countries \nexport to the United States have actually entered duty-free for 20 \nyears. By contrast, products that the U.S. has exported to CAFTA \ncountries face steep tariffs.\n  Currently the CAFTA countries apply an average tariff on U.S. \nindustrial goods ranging from 4.1 percent in Nicaragua to 7.8 percent \nin the Dominican Republic.\n  What we are doing here is creating a two-way street for trade between \nthe United States and CAFTA countries. This is a big trade issue for \nPennsylvania because merchandise exports to CAFTA countries totaled \n$353 million from Pennsylvania in 2004, the ninth largest among the 50 \nStates. And Pennsylvania's exports to the CAFTA region have grown 21 \npercent between 2000 and 2004.\n  I sympathize with the concerns that have been raised by CAFTA \ncritics, but if we look at the details I think this is an agreement \nthat we can afford to pass.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6175", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "CAFTA MYTHS", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6175", "title": "CAFTA MYTHS"}
