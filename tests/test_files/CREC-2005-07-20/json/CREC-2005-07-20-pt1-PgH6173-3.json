Mr. Speaker, this evening I rise in support of the United \nStates-Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement. This \nimportant agreement will benefit the businesses and workers not only in \nmy district but also throughout the rest of Florida and, yes, indeed, \nthe rest of this Nation.\n  The high tech companies located in and around my district will \nimmediately benefit from the elimination of duties and other barriers \nto trade. In addition, DR-CAFTA will protect the copyrights and \nintellectual property of those companies, thereby helping to spur \ninnovation.\n  The liberalization of services under DR-CAFTA will make it easier for \ntelecommunication, transportation, and computer service companies \nlocated in my district to explore new business opportunities in Central \nAmerica and Dominican Republic. Further, increased trade between \nFlorida and DR-CAFTA countries will lead to increased business for \nshippers and carriers moving goods in and out of the Ports of Palm \nBeach, the Everglades and Ft. Lauderdale and, yes, Port of Miami.\n  If we vote to approve DR-CAFTA we ensure future American \ncompetitiveness in Central America, the Dominican Republic and the \ncontinued growth of our economy. This will benefit my constituents and \nall Americans. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport this most important agreement.\n\n\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SHAW", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6173-H6174", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "DR-CAFTA WILL BENEFIT BUSINESSES AND WORKERS", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6173-3", "title": "DR-CAFTA WILL BENEFIT BUSINESSES AND WORKERS"}
