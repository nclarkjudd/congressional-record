Mr. Speaker, I rose with my colleague the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Cunningham) a few minutes ago to talk a little bit \nabout Admiral Jim Stockdale, a Medal of Honor winner; Jim Stockdale, \nPOW; Jim Stockdale, an overall great American, who passed away leaving \na wonderful family, but leaving also a family of Americans, all those \npeople who have flown aircraft in the skies of the world, projecting \nAmerican air power and protecting American freedom.\n  I thought it was appropriate that I stand here tonight talking about \nJim Stockdale with another great Navy pilot, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Cunningham), who on 10 May, 1972,\n\n\nsouth of Hanoi, was shot down by a SAM missile after he had shot down \nhis third MiG. He ejected and, thankfully, was picked up by a Marine \nrescue helicopter and so therefore did not have to suffer the 7 years \nof imprisonment that Jim Stockdale suffered.\n  I thought, Mr. Speaker, it would just be important for us to once \nagain recognize this enormous hero of the United States, a leader, a \nhero, a great model for all of us and for all those fighting in the war \nagainst terror right now, a wonderful figure for us to emulate in terms \nof following duty, honor and country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend, the gentleman from California (Mr. \nCunningham), and will listen to his memory of Jim Stockdale.", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. HUNTER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "C000994", "text": "  Mr. CUNNINGHAM. I thank the gentleman from California (Chairman \nHunter).\n  Mr. Speaker, Admiral Stockdale died on July 5 of this year. Some \npeople may not remember the name Admiral Stockdale, but millions of \npeople watched as the TV program portrayed the book that he and his \nwife Sybil wrote called ``In Love and War.'' It told about the plight \nof our POWs and how their families suffered. Millions of people saw \nthat.\n  They also may remember that Admiral Stockdale was Ross Perot's \nrunning mate one year in an alternative party, and then the following \nyear Admiral Stockdale supported John McCain in his run for presidency, \nalso a prisoner with Admiral Stockdale himself.\n  Admiral Stockdale was a prisoner for 7 years. He was awarded the \nMedal of Honor, not for just being a prisoner of war, but for his \nleadership and what he had to suffer through. He refused to capitulate \nto the enemy. That sounds like a big word, but not when you know what \nAdmiral Stockdale went through.\n  Admiral Stockdale was tortured because of his leadership and the \ncommunication system, the tap code that he set up for the other \nprisoners. He was tortured. His shoulders were ripped out of their \nsockets. For six months he was tortured until he was almost unable to \nspeak.\n  He was put in a cell then with our Member of Congress, Sam Johnson, \nwho was a prisoner of war for 7 years. Admiral Stockdale through the \ntap code turned over the leadership of all the prisoners of war to then \nformer Senator Jeremiah Denton. At that time, John McCain, Sam Johnson, \nJeremiah Denton and Admiral Stockdale were responsible for the \norganization of all of our prisoners of war.", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. CUNNINGHAM", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H000981", "text": "  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman \nfor laying out that great description of Admiral Stockdale. It has been \nrepeated many times, but I thought one of the extraordinary \ncircumstances, he was asked why he was able to be such a great leader, \nand he said he learned from his mother. He went to drama classes or \nhelped her in little theatrical shows where she led local drama shows \nand he learned to act spontaneously and also to think quickly.\n  I thought that was reflected when the North Vietnamese told him they \nwere going to parade him, use him for television, and were going to put \nhim out where he knew he would be used for propaganda purposes. He had \na stool in his cell. He tore it apart and took part of that stool and \nbeat himself in the face with it until he was unrecognizable. What a \nsurprise the North Vietnamese guards must have had when they came to \ntake Admiral Stockdale from his cell for his TV appearance and he had \nbeaten himself.\n  Also when he saw that other prisoners had been tortured and were \nbeing tortured and some of them had been killed, and the Vietnamese \nwere pressing him extremely hard, he took a razor and slit both of his \nwrists to show that he would rather die than break before his North \nVietnamese captors.\n  Part of that toughness he attributed to his commitment to his dad \nwhen he went off to the Naval Academy to be, as he said, ``the best \nmidshipman ever.''\n\n\n  I thought I would mention that Admiral Stockdale, besides being \nsurvived by Sybil, a wonderful, wonderful lady who then started, while \nhe was a POW, she started the League of American Families of Prisoners \nof War and MIAs and, at the same time, she raised four sons. Those four \nsons are James of Pennsylvania; Sydney, who is in New Mexico; Stanford \nof Denver, Colorado; and Taylor, who is living in Claremont, \nCalifornia, and, of course, Admiral Stockdale left eight grandchildren.\n  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman who is talking with me, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Cunningham), has won the Navy Cross, was nominated for \nthe Congressional Medal of Honor and the recipient of many other combat \nribbons, and the Purple Heart. But I have never seen a list of service \ndecorations as extensive as Admiral Stockdale's, who had two \nDistinguished Flying Crosses, the Medal of Honor, three Distinguished \nService Medals, two Purple Hearts and four Silver Stars, and was the \nonly 3-star admiral in the history of the Navy to wear both aviator \nwings and the Medal of Honor.\n  Interestingly, he went back, he wrote a number of books: ``The \nVietnam Experience: 10 Years of Reflections and Thoughts of a \nPhilosophical Fighter Pilot.'' So he continued to give to this country, \nI would say to my colleague, before I yield to him, he continued to \ngive to this country after he came back the value of his philosophy, \nand it was that tough philosophy, that great patriotic philosophy that \ngot him through these extraordinarily difficult times as a POW.\n", "turn": 3, "speaker": "Mr. HUNTER", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 4}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6181-H6182", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO ADMIRAL JAMES STOCKDALE", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6181-5", "title": "TRIBUTE TO ADMIRAL JAMES STOCKDALE"}
