Mr. Speaker, the United States is a leader in today's \nglobal economy. As countries around the world work and trade together \nat a rapidly growing pace, we must stay competitive to remain a \ncontender. The Central American Free Trade Agreement will help us do \njust that.\n  My home State of Washington is the most trade dependent State in the \ncountry. One in three jobs in Washington depends on trade. We must \nembrace CAFTA and see it as an opportunity to stimulate our economy and \nbe actively involved in a world market. The United States cannot afford \nto shrink from international trade and establish itself as an \nisolationist. The absence of our participation will only be seen as an \nopportunity by competing nations like China. Whether we are prepared to \nacknowledge it or not, we are in a global economy.\n  Mr. Speaker, this trade agreement builds America. In establishing an \nopen exchange with the Central American countries, we build our foreign \nrelations. By increasing circulation of goods, we build our economy. \nAnd in taking this step forward, we build on the future and the \npossibility that the entire Western hemisphere will one day be open to \nfree trade. CAFTA looks to the future of our country. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this agreement.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. REICHERT", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6113", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "CAFTA", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6113-3", "title": "CAFTA"}
