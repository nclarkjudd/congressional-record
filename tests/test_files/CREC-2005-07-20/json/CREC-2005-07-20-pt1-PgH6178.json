Madam Speaker, I want to speak today about how to come to \nAmerica. Millions of people apply for visas every year, and 90 percent \nof the people that legally come to this country do so through an \nimmediate family member. If someone has a mother, father, brother, \nsister or spouse in the United States, they may apply for immigrant \nvisas. They go to the United States consulate, fill out the appropriate \npaperwork, and then they wait, and continue to wait.\n  It is a long process even when they are fully eligible. According to \nthe State Department, unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens \nthat are in Mexico or some other foreign country that applied in 1983 \nare just now being considered for immigration status. Twenty years is \ntoo long to make people wait to enter the United States legally.\n  So while thousands of immigrants patiently wait, millions are \nsneaking in illegally and exploiting and disregarding American laws \nevery day.\n  Madam Speaker, I would like to bring to your attention the illegal \nway to come to America. An illegal can walk to the local Mexican flea \nmarket, purchase a combination of fake documents. For $100 or $200, an \nillegal can purchase a fake green card as well as a fake Social \nSecurity card with the number picked at random. They can borrow someone \nelse's Social Security number, and the next step is crossing the \nborder. This does not seem to be too difficult, especially since the \nMexican Ministry of Foreign Relations has made available to Mexican \nmigrants that want to come to the United States this extensive book on \nhow to come to America, even illegally.\n  The cover of this book, Guide for the Mexican Migrant. Throughout \nthis book it shows possible scenarios that could occur to the migrant. \nFirst of all, it shows how to cross the border. You run across. If you \ncome across an American border agent, how you handle that situation. It \ndiscusses how some places are not as safe as others to cross the \nborder, and it talks about coyotes, those people who are bringing \nillegal individuals into the United States, and how to deal with those \nindividuals. This book is extensive on how to come to America the \nillegal way published by the Mexican government.\n  Once they get into the United States, it is simple to visit their \nlocal consular, and for $26 they can purchase a matricula consular \ncard, which is a so-called identification card issued by the Mexican \nconsulate to prove an illegal immigrant's identity. This card has been \npushed onto the United States Federal Government. The Mexican \ngovernment wants the Federal Government to use these identification \ncards, but the Federal Government refuses to do so. So Mexican \nconsulates are going to local communities, local governments and trying \nto get them and businesses to use this document.\n  The card resembles a driver's license and is becoming widely accepted \nas a form of identification at many of the Nation's banks, car \ndealerships, insurance companies, and even in some States they are \nallowing individuals to purchase or get driver's licenses based upon \nthis document. It is so widely accepted that many companies are \nspending millions of dollars marketing directly to these migrant card \nholders.\n  It is a total lack of enforcement of our immigration law by the \nFederal Government that puts businesses in the United States in this \nprecarious position. It seems to me to come to the United States is not \nthat difficult. In May of this year, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity arrested 60 illegal immigrants who worked in 12 critical \ninfrastructure sites in six States, including my home State of Texas.\n  Illegal immigrants were working as subcontractors at seven \npetrochemical refineries, three electric power plants, and a pipeline \nfacility. They were said to have presented phony documents and some of \nthem had entered the country after being deported once before.\n  Although this may sound distressing, it is not shocking considering \nthat we require employers to accept 94 different documents to verify an \nemployee's legal status. The United States policy makes businesses in \nthe United States do the police work that the Federal Government ought \nto be doing.\n  There seems to be a growing amount of fraud associated with Social \nSecurity cards as well. Illegal immigrants use fake Social Security \ncards, they buy legitimate Social Security cards from migrants, and \nsome of them use the same Social Security card at different times.\n  In 1986, the United States offered amnesty to millions of illegal \nindividuals, and we are still suffering from that policy because it is \nestimated that 3 million of those immigrants received resident papers \nand went directly back to their homeland where they made a profit from \nloaning out those papers to other individuals in their homeland, and \nthen they came to the United States and used them.\n  Most of this is taking place unbeknownst to the employer that \nunknowingly accepted the fraudulent document in the first place. Not \nonly is this widespread use of fake documents deplorable, it is also \ndetrimental to homeland security. Eighteen of the 19 hijackers \npossessed either a State-issued or counterfeit driver's license or ID, \nand all 19 of them had obtained some sort of Social Security number.\n  And the word has gotten out. Due to the widespread acceptance of the \nmatricula consular card, other countries such as Guatemala, Honduras, \nEl Salvador, Nicaragua, Peru, and even Poland are preparing to issue \nsimilar cards for their own citizens that come to the United States \nillegally; and why not? Clearly we are not punishing those that \ncontinue to break the law and exploit America's compassion to other \nforeign citizens.\n  Madam Speaker, if the United States expects to solve the immigrant \nproblem, we must come up with a plan to stop the widespread use of \nfraudulent documents. If we are truly, as ``Business Week'' puts it, \n``embracing illegals,'' then our homeland is at risk.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. POE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6178", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "COMING TO AMERICA THE ILLEGAL WAY", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6178", "title": "COMING TO AMERICA THE ILLEGAL WAY"}
