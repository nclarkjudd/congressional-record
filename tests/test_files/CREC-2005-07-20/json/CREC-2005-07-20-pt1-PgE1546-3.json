Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the lifelong \nservice of Mr. Robert R. Mannings. Serving in the armed service during \nthe Korean War, Mannings selflessly devoted his life to his country and \nwas honorably discharged in 1953. Thereafter, Mr. Mannings began his \nexemplary career in Philadelphia in 1958 as an employee of both North \nCarolina Mutual Life Insurance Company and Yellow Cab Company. \nSubsequently, he joined the Iron Workers Local 401 and served as a \njourneyman worker until his retirement in 1992.\n  As the president of the Dewey and Race Street Civic Organization for \nover 20 years, he improved the quality of his Philadelphia community \nand consequently was awarded the Philadelphia Most Beautiful Block \naward. Mannings' civic engagement extends to countless organizations \nincluding his active membership in the West Philadelphia New Life \nDevelopment Association and the Mount Carmel Baptist Church for over 38 \nyears.\n  A survivor of two bouts of severe cancer, Mannings loyalty to the \nAmerican Cancer Society compelled him to create an educational video \nportraying the success of cancer survivors. This video is widely shown \nat medical conventions, in physician offices and seminars.\n  Robert Mannings' devotion to his community never distracted him from \nhis role as a loving husband to Frances E. Thomas, father of two \nchildren, grandfather of five, and great grandfather of seven. In \nrecognition of Mr. Robert R. Mannings' years of service to the city of \nPhiladelphia, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues rise \nto congratulate him on his retirement.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1546", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO MR.
