Mr. Speaker, Texas and our Nation has lost one \nof its most genuine and gracious public servants. Last Saturday \nmorning, James Jarell Pickle, ``Jake,'' passed away on Saturday, with \nhis wife by his side. For 31 years, Congressman Jake Pickle represented \nmy hometown in this esteemed body as a Representative to the 10th \nCongressional District of Texas. And he did so with integrity, \nhumility, honor, and a sense of humor that we should all attempt to \nmirror.\n  As a current holder of Congressman Pickle's seat, I work hard every \nday to provide the same kind of service to my constituents that Jake \nPickle did to those he served. He was not just good at what he did, he \nwas the best.\n  His family talks about the proudest vote he ever cast was in 1964 \nwhen he voted for the Civil Rights Act. He was one of only six southern \nRepresentatives to vote for that important piece of legislation. In the \n1980s, he worked hours on end to protect Social Security and keep it \nsolvent. He worked even harder in the 1990s to turn Austin into the \nhigh-tech society that it is today.\n  It is because of Jake Pickle that Austin continues to see new high-\ntech businesses locate to Texas's capital city. The University of Texas \nhas also benefited greatly because of Jake Pickle. UT would not be \nchurning out the latest in technology and new patents, as it now does \nevery year, without the help that Congressman Pickle provided. It is \nalso my honor to represent the research arm of the University of Texas \nwhich bears the name J.J. Pickle Research Campus.\n  But even as good and as smart a politician as he was, he is known \ntoday not for his ability to influence legislation or to help bring new\n\n\nbusiness to his district, but rather for being a good and decent man. \nIt is for this reason his nickname was Gentleman Jake. This gentleman \nserved in the Navy during World War II, and worked his way through \ncollege by delivering milk to Austin homeowners. During his first \ncongressional campaign and every time after when he was out in public, \nhe was shaking the hands of those he served. He enjoyed hearing about \ntheir lives and telling stories about his. He listened to their \nproblems and sometimes used his own money to fix whatever problems they \nwere having.\n  Representative Jake Pickle was a good man who will be terribly missed \nby all who knew him.\n  So tonight as I stand in the well of this esteemed body, a place so \nloved and respected by Jake, I am comforted in the thought that the \nLord above is thankful to have this great servant back home in heaven \nwhere I am sure he is telling stories and shaking the hands of everyone \nthat he meets.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McCAUL of Texas", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1542-E1543", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "IN REMEMBRANCE OF J.J.
