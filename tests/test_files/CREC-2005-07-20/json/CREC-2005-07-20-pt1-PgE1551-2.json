Mr. Speaker, I submit this statement for the \nRecord.\n\n                         Eulogy for J.J. Pickle\n\n                     (By Dr. William H. Cunningham)\n\n       Jake Pickle always referred to The University of Texas at \n     Austin as ``my University,'' and no one ever had a greater \n     right to that claim. When Jake said that, it was an \n     expression not of what The University owed to him, but of his \n     abiding love for it and all that he wanted to do to benefit \n     it.\n       And benefit The University he did. Across all the \n     generations, since The University was only a dream in the \n     heart of Dr. Ashbel Smith, no one has ever loved The \n     University of Texas more than Jake Pickle.\n       No one ever stood by The University with greater loyalty in \n     its time of need.\n       No one has ever worked harder to help it realize its vision \n     of greatness.\n       No one has ever given it wiser counsel or embraced it with \n     greater love.\n       And The University never had a greater friend.\n       So today we remember and celebrate a man in whose heart The \n     University held a central place. And we remember and \n     celebrate also the fact that Jake Pickle was central to the \n     rise of The University as an internationally prominent \n     institution.\n       The story of The University's development and flourishing \n     since the mid-20th century is a complex one, with many \n     chapters and versus and many personalities. But no one should \n     ever underestimate the crucial importance of the fact that \n     during much of that time The University was represented in \n     Congress by Jake Pickle.\n       I had the good fortune to talk with Jake on many occasions \n     about his experiences at The University, and he often said \n     that his decision to enroll at U. T. was one of the most \n     important decisions he ever made.\n       To a large extent, we can thank the Great Depression for \n     that decision. Jake's older brother and sisters had gone to \n     Baylor, and everybody was assuming that Jake would follow \n     them, but the Depression intervened and changed his plans \n     dramatically.\n       By the time Jake graduated from high school in his home \n     town of Big Spring in 1932, the family could no longer afford \n     to send him to Baylor, so Jake decided to enroll at The \n     University.\n\n\n       Jake's father had saved a grand total of $65 to get Jake \n     started as a freshman in September of 1932. Tuition was $25 a \n     semester, and Jake's room at the Little Campus Dormitory was \n     another $25, so that left him with $15 for books and \n     everything else.\n       He soon got a job delivering milk to the other residents of \n     the dormitory and made as much as twenty five cents a day--\n     enough to buy a full meal.\n       But even more important than the money, Jake told me that \n     his milk route enabled him to get to know the other 140 \n     students in the dormitory, and those friendships later became \n     the foundation of his success in campus politics--which, in \n     turn, laid the groundwork for his success in politics in the \n     wider world.\n       Like Jake, those boys were from relatively poor families, \n     drawn to the university from all over Texas by the \n     opportunity it offered for an affordable education, which in \n     turn provided a lifetime of additional social, economic, and \n     political opportunities.\n       With those 140 friends from Little Campus spread out across \n     the university, Jake found that he had a strong base of \n     support when he ran for the Student Assembly and the Texas \n     Union Board.\n       He later combined that base with the growing circle of \n     campus friends and supporters that he and fellow student John \n     Connally attracted when each of them ran for president of the \n     Student Government. By the way, each of them served as the \n     other's campaign manager in those elections.\n       Jake served as president of the student body after he \n     entered law school in 1937, and Connally was elected the next \n     year. They both ran as ``independents,'' rather than as \n     representatives of the powerful fraternity and sorority \n     cliques, but they also had a lot of support through the Delta \n     Theta Phi fraternity--a group that Jake said went by the \n     nickname of the ``Dollar Thirty-Fives.''\n       Campus politics was a serious contact sport in those days, \n     and more than one political rival learned that Jake Pickle \n     and John Connally were formidable politicians.\n       As Jake told me: ``At first Connally and I went in with the \n     fraternities and sororities and other groups in what we \n     called the People's Political Party, but the fraternities \n     decided that the Little Campus men were becoming too powerful \n     so they kicked us out. So then John and I joined together and \n     organized all the independents, all the dorms and boarding \n     houses, and everything else on the campus. We divided the \n     campus into precincts and had a chairman for every one. We \n     found that there were more have-nots than haves.''\n       Jake called the experience ``the best political training \n     anybody could have.''\n       He told me another great story about his campaign for \n     student body president. There were three candidates--Bob \n     Eckhardt, who was another independent like Jake, and Ramsey \n     Moore, who was the candidate put forward by the fraternities \n     and sororities. Jake and John Connally were worried that the \n     independent vote would be split, thus giving the election to \n     the Greek candidate.\n       First they tried to persuade Bob Eckhardt to drop out, but \n     when that didn't work Connally came up with the idea of \n     having a runoff election if no one won a majority. They \n     researched the matter and found that it was permitted by the \n     student constitution although, apparently, student body \n     presidents had always been elected with just a plurality of \n     the votes. Whether to have a runoff became a major issue \n     across the campus, and Jake and John stirred up student \n     opinion and circulated a runoff petition, so the Greeks \n     finally had to accept the idea or appear to be undemocratic.\n       Well, the runoff plan backfired, because, to everyone's \n     surprise, Jake came out on top in the first round of voting! \n     If they hadn't sold everybody on the runoff, Jake would have \n     been elected that night.\n       Jake told me he went to see Dean Shorty Nowotny to ask him \n     what he should do--have a runoff or not--and Shorty told Jake \n     it was up to him. Jake wrestled with the idea of ignoring his \n     own runoff petition, but he finally decided that going ahead \n     with the runoff was the right thing to do.\n       Jake went on to win the runoff election and take office as \n     president!\n       That campaign was also notable for Jake's use of his now \n     famous ``Pickle Pins.'' He got the idea from the H.J. Heinz \n     Co., which had given away the green pickle-shaped pins at a \n     World's Fair. Jake said he wrote to Heinz and asked to have \n     any of their old pins, and they sent him five thousand of \n     them. He and his volunteers covered up the Heinz name and \n     wrote ``Jake'' across every one of them!\n       Jake never forgot the way The University brought together \n     people from all walks of life, from every station in society \n     and from all economic backgrounds, and gave them all a chance \n     to achieve and excel.\n       He never forgot the friends that he made during his student \n     days and the hardships and triumphs that they shared. And, of \n     course, he never forgot The University itself.\n       When Jake first ran for Congress he campaigned on the idea \n     of strengthening the Balcones Research Center and developing \n     it into a truly world-class research and development \n     facility. Building on the work of Lyndon Johnson and others \n     through the years, Jake helped The University finally gain \n     title to the Balcones site in 1971, and he contributed in \n     many ways to advancing the status of research facilities at \n     the site. Much of this work was accomplished through Jake's \n     chairmanship of the House Science, Space, and Technology \n     Committee.\n       In 1994, The University of Texas System Board of Regents \n     renamed the Balcones Research Center as the J. J. Pickle \n     Research Campus in honor of Jake's noble work in support of \n     this outstanding educational enterprise.\n       Jake's tireless labors on behalf of The University \n     frequently encompassed the arcane nuts and bolts of federal \n     tax policy, and he got things done that nobody else could \n     have. For example, he helped get University oil revenues \n     excluded from the windfall profits tax of the 1970s. And \n     another time, he was instrumental in passing a tax credit \n     that helped direct private-sector resources into university \n     research and development--not just at U.T. but at \n     universities across the nation.\n       And he was a genius at finding ways to get the federal \n     budget to come to The University's rescue in a time of \n     crisis.\n       I know that Provost Gerry Fonken, Vice Provost Steve Monti, \n     and Dean of Engineering Herb Woodson will never forget the \n     day back in 1991 when we met with Jake at the Willard Hotel \n     in Washington to try to save our microelectronics building \n     from disaster. Somehow, The University had ``value \n     engineered'' enough money out of the project so that upon its \n     completion it was nothing more than a shell of a building. \n     This $10 million problem was presented to the Board of \n     Regents by U.T. System Chancellor Hans Mark and Executive \n     Vice Chancellor Jim Duncan. I was called in to explain how I \n     was going to solve the problem. I turned to the Regents and \n     said I have a plan. Fortunately for me, they accepted my \n     brash confidence and proceeded to the next item of business. \n     Unfortunately for me, I had no plan.\n       However, I did know how to call my Congressman, our \n     Congressman, the Congressman Jake Pickle.\n       Within two weeks of the Regent's meeting, Gerry, Steve, \n     Herb and I were nervously waiting in the dining room of the \n     Willard Hotel to meet with Jake. He and Beryl came charging \n     into the dining room.\n       Jake was running his hands through his hair, and he \n     announced before he even sat down, ``I don't know what the \n     problem is, but I will solve it!'' Within one hour he laid \n     out a strategy that involved Jim Wright, Lloyd Bentsen, and \n     Phil Gramm. With a little luck and lots of hard work, in less \n     than two years Congress implemented the Pickle plan and The \n     University was able to successfully ``compete'' for a special \n     $10 million package to support microelectronics and material \n     science.\n       Now that's the kind of Congressman everybody ought to have!\n       When I think back across the years and recall all those \n     times that I had the good fortune to meet with Jake, two \n     over-riding impressions stand out.\n       First, it was clear that he was a man who combined the \n     qualities of uncommon vision, boundless energy, and enviable \n     political skill--and that he was always instantly ready and \n     will to bring those talents to bear for the benefit of his \n     University and its succeeding generations of students.\n       And second, it was always clear that underlying everything \n     Jake did was his great love of people, the immense joy that \n     he felt just by being in the company of other people--\n     listening to them, caring about them, sharing stories and \n     memories, and, yes, sharing with them the dream for a better \n     future.\n       In all these ways, Jake embodied the spirit of American \n     democracy at its best--a spirit of optimism and hope and good \n     cheer; a spirit of inclusiveness and opportunity; and a \n     spirit of public service that embraced honesty, hard work, \n     practical problem solving, and faithfulness to the \n     fundamental values and principles of representative \n     grovernment.\n       We all loved Jake, and we will always treasure his memory--\n     a memory that will last for as long as the lights on the U.T. \n     tower orange and for as long as young Texans continue to come \n     to Austin seeking education and opportunity at Their \n     University.\n       Jake, we love you, and HookEm' Horns!\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1551-E1552", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "IN MEMORY OF CONGRESSMAN JAKE PICKLE", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgE1551-2", "title": "IN MEMORY OF CONGRESSMAN JAKE PICKLE"}
