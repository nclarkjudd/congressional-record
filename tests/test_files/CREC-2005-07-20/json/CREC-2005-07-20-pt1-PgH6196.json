Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor tonight in part of a \ncontinuing discussion of our national energy policy, and I come \nspecifically this evening to address some new science. There have been \ntwo new developments that are important to America in regard to our \nenergy policy. One is some very new emerging science indicating that we \nneed to change our energy policy and have one that is much more \noptimistic and visionary; and, two, the results of the energy policy \nbill that has come out of the House that is now in the conference \ncommittee that unfortunately has fallen very short of what this country \nneeds.\n  And, third, I will finish with an optimistic note about a discussion \nof how this country can adopt a truly new technologically oriented, \noptimistic, can-do energy policy that can help our country break our \naddiction to Middle Eastern oil, stop global warming, and grow jobs in \nthis country with these new energy sources that we need to develop.\n  But first I would like to start the discussion by talking about some \nemerging science. There really are three reasons that we need a new \ntechnologically oriented clean energy policy for America. We clearly \nneed to break our addiction on Saudi Arabian oil that is a security \nthreat to the United States. That is number one. And we can do it with \na high-tech future.\n  Number two, we have to stop global warming, which is a real threat \nand the science that I will talk about is in that regard. And, three, \nwe need to grow our economy by having the next generation of \ntechnological development to truly have a new breakthrough energy \npolicy for this country.\n  But I would like to start tonight's discussion by talking about some \nnew science that has come in just in the last several weeks that has a \nbearing on our need for a clean energy future in this country. This \nscience has been accumulating for the last decade or so; but it is very \ninteresting just in the last several weeks, we have had some very \nfundamentally profoundly disturbing scientific revelations that lead to \nthe conclusion that our Nation needs to lead the world to a new energy \nfuture.\n  I would like to set the stage, if I can, to talking about some of the \nthings that have been known, at least on a gross basis, that are \nhappening in the world today. And basically what is happening in the \nworld today is in a real sense, it is melting. I want to refer to a \npicture of the Upsala Glacier in Patagonia at the southern tip of South \nAmerica, a picture here taken in 1928. This huge glacier at the tip of \nSouth America. You can see it here, pretty vast field of ice in 1928. \nSame picture taken in 2004, basically showing the disappearance of this \nenormous multisquare mile field of ice that in this photograph has \ndisappeared and now is essentially a bay at the southern tip of South \nAmerica, an incredibly rapid, rapid change since 1928. This picture \nunfortunately is very typical of what is happening in glaciers around \nthe world due to the warming of the Earth.\n  A picture to show that it is not limited to South America. This is a \nphotograph of the good old United States of America, one of my favorite \nnational parks, Glacier National Park. On the left it shows a picture \nof the Grinnell Glacier in 1938. You can see it extends down into this \nbasin, comes off this cliff, has a rather large area of flat glacier \ndown in this area.\n  Same picture, same observation point in 1981. You see that this \nextent of the glacier has now totally disappeared. There is a lake \nwhere the glacier used to be. The Grinnell Glacier is rapidly receding. \nThere were 150 glaciers in Glacier National Park a hundred years ago. \nThere are about 30 significant ones now. And the scientists project \nthat in one of our most treasured jewels of our crown, we will have no \nglaciers of any significance in Glacier National Park 50 years from \nnow.\n  So, in fact, what we see is that due to a national or a global \nphenomenon, some of the most pristine treasures of America are being \ndestroyed by global warming, and so our grandchildren, in hopes of \nhaving some some day, our great grandchildren will have to say we will \ntake you to the park formerly known as Glacier because it will not have \nglaciers anymore.\n  The point I would like to make is that this is not just an isolated \nregional occurrence happening at the southern tip of South America or \nin our treasured Glacier National Park. In fact, it is something that \nis happening all over the globe. We now know some information that \nshows the thickness of long-term perennial ice in the north, and we now \nhave very, very conclusive evidence that that ice is melting \nsignificantly.\n  This is a graph showing the extent and thickness of the ice cover in \nthe Arctic in various locations during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s \ncompared to the thickness with observations taken in the last 15 years. \nThe blue, for instance, at the North Pole, shows the meters, just under \n4 meters of thickness of ice at the North Pole on average in the 1950s, \n1960s, and 1970s. The brown bars show the thickness in the last 15 \nyears. You see it has gone down to under 2\\1/2\\ meters of thickness, \nprobably a 40 percent reduction in thickness at the North Pole.\n  It is not isolated. In the Nansin Basin there was about 4 meters of \nthickness. It has gone down to about 2.25 meters. In the Eastern \nArctic, it is even more pronounced, from about 3.4 meters down to about \n1\\1/2\\ meters. It is the same story all across the Arctic. The Arctic \nis melting. It is becoming less thick by factors of almost half. Just \nunder half of the ice in the Arctic is gone as a result of global \nwarming, something that we have grown up with, something that 15 years \nago we could not have imagined could disappear.\n\n\n  It is not just the thickness and it is not just in the Arctic. If you \nlook at Greenland, and Greenland for reasons I will talk about is one \nof the great question marks about what is going to happen to the world \nin the next century. Greenland is an enormous reservoir of ice, \nthousands of feet thick covering the continent. But what has happened \nin 2002, this is a map of Greenland, basically showing where the melt \nhas been in 2002 in these red areas. And you see a rather pronounced \narea where you have had this very significant melting along the \nperiphery of the Greenland ice sheet.\n  What scientists have found is a very disturbing phenomenon that has \noccurred in Greenland and that is that there have been these fissures \nor crevasses open up that allow this melt water to melt down which \nlubricates the glacier which hastens the seaward spread of the glacier \nwhich can even accelerate the melting even further. This is of \ntremendous concern. This may get technical but let me notice it.\n  This is a hidden time but when it comes to climate in Greenland. The \nreason is off of Greenland is the Atlantic current that operates \nbecause of the saltiness, what is called the Halcyon Cycle of cold salt \nwater sinking that creates this current that warms northern Europe, \nwarms the northern Atlantic States of America.\n  If this ice melts in Greenland it can shut down the Gulf Current. In \nfact it has done that thousands of years ago. It happened at least once \nbefore, shut that current down and actually precipitated, and here is \none of the great ironies, a little ice age in the northern hemisphere. \nThat is why the Europeans are terrified of what is happening in \nGreenland today of this ice melting, making the water fresher, possibly \nshutting down this Atlantic current, causing this enormous change in \nour climate factor, a situation in the north Atlantic.\n  I want to point out these are not hypotheticals, these are not \ntheories. These are not suggestions. These are not abstractions. These \nare facts. The things I have talked about today are direct \nobservations. No scientist in the world questions them. They are \nunequivocal and there is no use arguing about them.\n  So what we have is a rather pronounced worldwide melting of ice and \nthe question now is why is that? Well, there is a clear reason that has \nnow been answered by the scientific community from the international \npanel of scientists, of over 1,500 scientists from around the world, \nfrom every bent, from every philosophical standpoint, geophysicists, \ngeologists, physicists, climatologists, you name it, in the largest \ngathering of world scientists ever dealing with a climatic issue.\n\n\n  They have said with great confidence that human factors are causing \nthe climate to change, are a significant factor in that change. The \nNational Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, and I am \nproud of the United States of America, we are the world's greatest \nscientific authority in the world. Our National Academy of Sciences, \nthe people to whom we trust the scientific intellectual treasure trove \nof America, a few months ago came out with a conclusion that human \nactivities are a significant cause of the climate change that the world \nis now experiencing. These are not fruitcakes, crackpots or small \ngranola eaters. These are the people that helped put us on the moon, \ndevelop nuclear energy, and basically are the reason the United States \nleads the world today. We need to listen to them when they tell us \nsomething very dangerous is going on in the world today.\n  What is that? It is global warming caused by gasses that we, all of \nus, put into the atmosphere, and I would like to talk about that for a \nmoment.\n  There is a phenomenon that actually is a really good thing. The \npresence of carbon dioxide is really important for us to live. Right \nnow, carbon dioxide, we need to reduce the amount we are putting in the \nair because carbon dioxide and methane and a few other gasses are \ncausing this global warming. But do not forget it is actually vital to \nhuman life on the planet, because carbon dioxide warms the planet. If \ncarbon dioxide and water vapor and other things were not in the air, we \nwould live on a frozen planet. So having the right amount of carbon \ndioxide is very important. Too much is a problem and that is what we \nare experiencing now.\n  The reason this works, carbon dioxide, it is like a greenhouse. You \nhave heard of the greenhouse effect. It very much is like a greenhouse. \nCarbon dioxide allows energy in but does not allow energy out. It is \nlike a pane of glass. Just like a pane of glass it has a certain \nattribute. And scientists taught me this and I will share with you this \ntrick, how this works.\n  CO2 is like glass in that it allows light energy to come \nin but not go out. It is like a one-way door. And the reason it is like \nthat is that CO2 molecules block ultraviolet rays of light, \nlight at a certain spectrum, excuse me, allows it in, allows \nultraviolet rays from the sun in to the Earth, and that is the warming \ncomponent coming in. But when light bounces back into space, it bounces \nback at a different frequency, at infrared frequencies.\n  It holds the energy in and that is good to a certain degree, but the \nproblem is now is that the carbon dioxide levels in the air have gone \nup dramatically and so we have a thicker blanket on the Earth trapping \nthis energy to a significant degree. Let me talk about now how \nsignificant that is.\n  The numbers I am now going to talk about are also fact. They are not \nabstractions or hypotheticals. This chart basically shows the \nCO2 concentrations in a red line. This is the most \ndisturbing red line that I know of in the world today in the long term \nbecause what it shows is for the last thousand years what the carbon \ndioxide levels were on this red line, and that is expressed in parts \nper million, how many molecules of CO2 per million there are \nin the atmosphere.\n  If you see a thousand years earlier it was about 280, 278 parts per \nmillion on the left side of the chart. We know this because it is \npretty amazing. We have air from that period, because there are trapped \nair bubbles that were trapped by these glaciers a thousand years ago. \nScientists drill a core into the ice and they get those little air \nbubbles and they put them on a devices that measures the concentration \nof CO2 and you know exactly how much CO2 there \nwas. So this is a very precise measurement.\n\n  So we know a thousand years ago CO2 levels were 278 or \n280. You will see the next hundred years are about the same. The next \nhundred about the same. The next hundred there are some minor \ndeviations 500 or 600 years ago. They are staying about the same. Then \nabout a hundred years ago we started to see an uptick of CO2 \nlevels starting to rise. Something happened about a hundred years ago \nor a little more than a hundred years ago causing carbon dioxide levels \nto rise.\n  What happened is we started to burn coal and oil. When we burn coal \nit puts carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. So those levels of carbon \ndioxide started to go up, and they kept going up and now they are going \nup at a rate unprecedented in global history. As far as we know this is \nthe fastest rate of CO2 acquisition or increase in global \nhistory. And what we see now is we are now up to about 370, I believe \nit is about 378 parts per million. So we have gone from about 275 a \nthousand years ago and just in the last hundred years we have gone up \nabout half of that again up to about 373, 378 parts per million. So we \nwere a third or half, depending on how you categorize that number, \nhigher than we were and what are called pre-industrial times.\n  Now, why is that important? Well, it is pretty obvious. If \nCO2 captures heat and it traps heat and you increase the \ncarbon dioxide, you are going to increase the energy that is trapped in \nthe Earth and the temperature of the Earth if it is not used in some \nother fashion. And that is indeed what has happened. We see \ntemperatures spikes shown in these blue areas. And the blue shows the \nvariations and, of course, the temperature does vary to some degree \nfrom year to year and even decade to decade. But what we see is we have \nhad a corresponding increase in temperatures on the Earth as well.\n  The scientific community has come together to tie those two together, \nand frankly it makes sense to me that if you increase carbon dioxide by \na third, as much as you had in pre-industrial times, it is likely you \nare going to trap energy in the Earth, and that is exactly what has \nhappened.\n  It is not just the last thousand years that this correlation has \ntaken place. I want to show a chart which is also observational \nevidence. This is a chart that is very similar. It shows carbon dioxide \nlevels again in the red line and temperatures in the blue only it goes \nback 400,000 years. It takes us back further in time. And what we see \nis that 400,000 years ago we were about 250 and the red line went down \nand went up and went down and it went down and it went up. And you will \nnotice corresponding changes in the temperature at the same time. When \ncarbon dioxide has gone down, the average temperatures have gone down. \nNotice we have had some deviation over the 400,000 years.\n  Carbon dioxide levels have gone up and down. But also notice this, \nthey have never in the last 400,000 years been as high as they are. \nThis is the highest they have ever been, number one. And, number two, \nthe rate of increase is now on this graph essentially a vertical line. \nThe rate of increase of the amount we are putting of carbon dioxide is \nunprecedented in global history.\n  So if we look the projection is that if things remain the same we \nwill be up to 550 parts per million by 2050, my kids' lifetime. And by \n2100 we will be up to 1,280 parts per million taking a worst case \nprojection. So however you slice it, we are going to have somewhere \nbetween a doubling of carbon dioxide and a quadrupling of carbon \ndioxide in the next hundred years compared to pre-industrial times.\n  This is bad news for the Earth because we have a system built on a \nclimate regime consistent with somewhere around 300 part per million. \nAnd our crops, where our fish are, where we live, how much air \nconditioning we use, whether we are comfortable or hotter than heck \nwill all change as these CO2 levels skyrocket.\n  Now, these are observational issues, observational facts as well that \nI have given you. Obviously, this is a projection but one that is based \non the best available scientific evidence that we have.\n  Now it just in the atmosphere? No, it is not just in the atmosphere. \nOne of the categorical things that our own oceanographic folks in the \nUnited States Government have been studying temperatures in the ocean \nas well because the ocean is a very efficient sink of energy. It is a \nstorage battery for energy. What they have found is that ocean \ntemperatures as well, and this graph is expressed in heat content \nrather than temperature, and that is watts per year per meters squared.\n  The ocean essentially going back from 1993 has had observational \nchanges that have gone up dramatically, as this graph would show, to \n2003 as well. And this is actually a piece that had fallen into the \nscientific puzzle to answer this question when we\n\n\nhave recently found huge amounts of energy essentially stored in the \nocean.\n  Now, this is a concern because the ocean expands as it gets warmer. \nAnd if you live on the coastline as I do, the State of Washington, or \naround Florida or anywhere else for that matter, you need to be \nconcerned about rising ocean levels, not like a tsunami but on a \ncreeping basis, that could inundate significant parts of our coastline \nin the next hundred years. That expanding phenomenon of water is also \nincreased by the melting of Greenland. And we have projections of \nanywhere from several centimeters to several meters in the next 100 to \n150 years potentially inundating our coastlines. So we have not just \nthe air but the water associated with these problems.\n  Now, I want to note how this, the things that have happened in the \nlast 4 months that have nailed the nail in the coffin of debate about \nwhether or not global warming has been caused by human, in part, by \nhuman-caused action.\n\n\n  Basically, I think that one of the major newspapers I was seeing had \na headline that said ``The Debate is Over: It's Fact.'' And I think \nthat pretty much summarizes the state of this situation.\n  Arguing about whether or not global warming exists right now is a \nlittle bit like arguing gravity. It is something you could do several \nhundred years ago, but not today. We have a lot of questions about the \nextent, the rapidity, the rate of change, how much coastline will be \ninundated, how fast the West Nile virus will move north, how fast the \ntundra will melt. There are a lot of questions about how much and how \nfast; but the fact it is occurring, clearly, number one, is true; and, \nsecond, it is great cause for concern.\n  These are not abstractions. Our lives are changing today because of \nthis. The ski industry in the Cascade Mountains in Washington \nessentially was shut down this year. My son is a ski patrolman. He \nworked for 3 days this year. There was no snow. And having no snow is \nconsistent with what the models predict will become a significant \nproblem for us in the future. And it is not just skiing; we get our \nirrigation water from there. We run our power in the Pacific Northwest \nfrom there. We are experiencing these problems today.\n  I talked to a friend of mine who went fishing off the coast of \nWashington. Not many salmon, because the water is six to eight degrees \nwarmer than it has ever been. In fact, we are getting species that have \nnever been seen off the Washington coast. Tuna. Certain species of tuna \nnever seen before off the Washington coast before are now moving north \nalong the coastline because of these warming temperatures.\n  If you go to Alaska, you will see houses that are falling down \nbecause the tundra is melting. And that is significant because the \ntundra, and this is what is called a multiplier, a feedback effect, \nwhen the tundra melts because of warming, it releases enormous amounts \nof methane. Methane gas is frozen and stored in the tundra, and when it \nis released, methane gas itself is a global-climated gas. It is four \ntimes worse than CO2. So when you melt the tundra, you \naccelerate the rate of change. Just like when you melt the ice, you \naccelerate the rate of warming.\n  And that is why the North has warmed up so much, because the ice has \nmelted and now the light is absorbed by the dark land rather than \nreflected back into space. It is called the feedback loop that \naccelerates the rate of warming that is going on. So we have the native \npopulations in Alaska now having to move their villages because of the \ncollapse of their coastline. And they are seeing the day when they may \nnot be able to hunt for seals any more because the ice is not coming \nclose to the shoreline to support the sea life.\n  West Nile virus. You have seen these maps that show where West Nile \nvirus has invaded the United States. It is not an accident that some of \nthese diseases are moving north that are carried by mosquitoes, because \nthose insects are moving north. It is not an accident that you are \nseeing these horrendous fires in the western United States, because the \ntrees have no moisture in them and they are also dying because of \nbeetle infestations.\n  Why did these beetles all of a sudden show up? These trees have been \nthere for eons. Why all of a sudden are these forests being killed by \nthese insect infestations? Well, one thing we can say is that the \nmilder winters allow these insects to live. So our forests are \nsignificantly affected by this situation.\n  The point I am making is that when you grow a garden in Seattle, \nWashington, right now, you notice that flowers are coming up earlier. \nThat might be a good thing, but it is not so good a thing if it means \nwe are not someday going to be able to grow wheat in southern regions \nof the Midwest because it will not support that type of vegetation. So \nthe point is there are real things happening today; and, sadly, we are \nnot responding to them.\n  Coming back to the pieces of the puzzle that have come into play very \nrecently, there has been a lot of debate about global warming; and as \nmany things in science do, we have advanced from questions to \nhypotheses to theories to observations to arguments to debates to \nconsensus. There is a consensus in the worldwide scientific community \nthat humans are now playing a role in climate change that is assuredly \naffecting the globe. And in the last several months, there have been \nseveral major studies by very well accredited organizations that have \ncome up with pieces to that puzzle.\n  For instance, in the last 2 weeks, the Royal Academy of Science in \nBritain completed a study of the acidity in our world's oceans. Now, \nthe acidity of our world's oceans are affected by the amount of carbon \ndioxide in the atmosphere that is then dissolved in the ocean. Because \ncarbon dioxide, through a chemical reaction, can make the world's \noceans more acidic. They are a little bit alkaline-based now.\n  Now, the Royal Academy of Sciences goes back to Isaac Newton, I \nthink. Talk about a prestigious group. How are you going to argue with \nthis group? They have concluded that there is a very significant \nincrease in the acidity of the world's oceans because of the increased \ncarbon dioxide going into the atmosphere. That amount, if I understand \nthis correctly, is almost a 30 percent increase in the acidity. It is \nstill alkaline, but it is becoming more acidic, and it is going down in \na PH level from, and my numbers may not be correct, if you want to \ncheck this, you can go on a Web site called realclimate, it is either \ndot-org or dot-com, which should give you the numbers. But it is a \nlogarithmic scale. You can see it has gone from 8.5 to 8.2 or 8.1.\n  Now, that does not sound like much, but it is a logarithmic scale, \nwhich means about a 30 percent change, which is significant. And that \nis significant because life in the ocean, our coral reefs or shellfish, \nor anything that makes calcium-based covering, like shells and corals, \ndepends on that level of acidity to allow their life forms to exist.\n  Our coral reefs now are in deep trouble because of temperature. We \nhave had massive bleaching, which is basically the death of coral \nreefs. They have a life form that builds the reef, and those have died \njust because of the warmer water. But the changes in the acidity \nlevels, the PH levels, is also a means of mortality for our reef \nsystem. Many scientists are very concerned that this could greatly \nupset the balance of life in our oceans associated with anything that \nessentially uses calcium that is affected by the PH levels in the \nwater.\n  So there is one thing that has changed. The National Academy of \nSciences, secondly, America's most prestigious organization, and a \npretty conservative group, not known for wild ideas, in the last \nseveral months came out and said that they had a consensus that human \nactivity is a significant factor in global warming. A significant \nsecond thing.\n  Third thing. A study done of the world's oceans by a third group \nconcluded that the salinity of our oceans is changing significantly \nbecause of this fresh water melt coming off from Greenland. When \nGreenland melts and the Arctic melts, that fresh water goes somewhere. \nIt goes in the ocean and changes the salinity levels because that ice \nis melting.\n  Fourth. We have seen significant localized temperature differences of \nvarying significant degrees, six to eight degrees off the coast of \nWashington, for instance. Those are just\n\n\nthings in the last several months that are occurring.\n  Now, what they add up to is a picture of a changing globe, one that \nwe are partially responsible for and one that we do not know exactly \nwhere it is going. I talked to a scientist down in South America who is \nstudying the rain forest; and he is finding that the vines, now this \nwas in Panama, and he was one of the first guys that had a crane and \nthey put these big cranes up and the crane goes around, they have a \nlittle basket and they can look at the top of the rain forests. I went \nup in one of those cranes. They cover about 2\\1/2\\ acres of ground. It \nis amazing being up there.\n  This scientist told me that in studying the rain forest, what they \nhave found is that the type of vegetation in the rain forest is \nchanging dramatically because of the increasing CO2 levels \nin the atmosphere. What we see on this chart at first seems like an \nabstraction; but when you see these CO2 levels going up \ndramatically in the atmosphere, that is not just an intellectually \ninteresting point. It means a change in our world.\n  What it means in the rain forest, this scientist told me, I think his \nname was George, though I cannot remember his last name, is that \ncertain plants metabolize carbon dioxide better than others and they \ngrow faster than others. What they found is the parasitic plants, the \nplants that basically use other plants for a structure, like vines, and \nthe vines are called lianas, and the lianas are increasing their rate \nof growth explosively and are sort of taking over the canopy of the \nrain forests.\n  So when we went up there, you could see these places where the canopy \nof the rain forest was just covered with vines. He told me that 25 \nyears ago that was simply not the case. So what we are seeing is major \nchanges in vegetation patterns in certain places associated with carbon \ndioxide as well.\n  So what do we conclude from this? Well, I think that we need to \nexercise common sense. What this scientist told me, and I thought his \ncharacterization of this problem was one of the most sort of \ncommonsense ones I have heard, he said we are now engaged in the \nlargest experiment in human history, and we are the guinea pigs. And he \nmeant by that that this whole global warming experiment that we are \nconducting in the world, we are the ones likely to be affected by it in \nways we cannot fully predict.\n  In other words, we cannot fully predict the year we will not be able \nto grow wheat in the southern Midwest. We cannot predict that. We \ncannot predict the year we will not be able to power our electrical \nturbines in the Pacific Northwest because of the lack of snowpack, or \nthe year that we will have a 20 percent reduction. We cannot predict \nwhen that will happen. We cannot predict the year that malaria will \nspread significantly north in various environments. We really cannot \npredict when that will be. We cannot predict when we will have to move \nthe villages in the Arctic because of the receding shoreline. We cannot \npredict the dates those things will happen, but we are running this \nlarge craps game about what we are doing with our Earth by continuing \nin this course of putting carbon dioxide in the air in this steady \ncurve.\n  And now I am going to come to what this Congress has to do with this. \nWhat the United States House of Representatives, and there are 435 \npeople who work here, 100 over in the Senate, and there is one \nPresident and one Vice President, what that group has decided pretty \nmuch, at least the majority at the moment, what they have decided is \nthat this explosion of carbon dioxide, this enormous ramp-up of carbon \ndioxide that has never happened before in the Earth's history as far as \nwe know, that is having these prolific changes on life forms across the \nworld is just hunky-dory and that we can just take our chances.\n  This U.S. Congress has decided to just roll the dice and let it \nhappen, no matter what is going to happen. We do not have either the \ninsight or the instinct or the willingness to do anything about this \nproblem. And I stand here tonight to say that anybody that spends just \na few minutes, just a few minutes acquainting themselves with the \nrecent science on this issue will come away with the conclusion that \ninaction on this problem is massively irresponsible to our \ngrandchildren and our great grandchildren, and in some parts of the \nworld to ourselves.\n  That is the situation that is happening in the U.S. Congress because \nwe do not pay attention enough to the science that has shown the \nconclusion that we have a problem on our hands. This Congress has done \nnothing about this problem. The President is not willing to deal with \nthis problem. Disappointing. He ran for office saying he was going to \nsupport a carbon dioxide cap so we could put at least some limitation \non the carbon dioxide we put out. He ran for President telling the \nAmerican people he would do that, and he has not done a single thing \nabout global warming in the 5 years he has been in office.\n  There is no excuse for that dereliction of duty. None. He owes us \nbetter. And we are capable of doing better because we are the smartest, \nmost technologically oriented people in the world. We owe ourselves and \nour kids a solution to this problem.\n\n\n  Now what has the President said he was going to do about this \nproblem. Here is what he said he is going to do. He says he is going to \nhave a voluntary program where he will ask major players to volunteer \nto solve this problem.\n  Well, you can run a PTA bake sale on a voluntary basis, but you \ncannot reorient the energy policy of America on a volunteer bake sale. \nIt is a joke. It is a sham. We would rather have the President just \nadmit that he refuses to do anything about this problem. That would be \nstraightforward. But this volunteerism is nothing but a scam. We need \nto act. We need to do some common-sense things to deal with this \nCO2.\n  Why am I suggesting we have a cap on carbon dioxide. The reason is \nwhat we have found is when we cap these pollutants, it works. We have \nhad what is called a cap-in-trade system now for over a decade for \nsulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. That has been very successful. It \nhas limited those two pollutants without damaging our economy one hoot. \nAnd yet this pollutant, the one that is going off the charts, the \nPresident refuses to do anything about. We need a CO2 cap to \nlead us in ways that we can reduce our contributions of CO2.\n  Now there are some other common-sense things we can do. \nUnfortunately, we have not done them. We can improve the mileage we get \nfrom our vehicles. The reason we know that is we have done this. We \nknow that Congress can effectively increase the mileage of our \nvehicles. If you look at this graph that shows the mileage our vehicles \nhave gotten, as we increase our mileage, we reduce our CO2 \nemissions.\n  In 1975, our cars got 14 miles to a gallon. And then the Congress and \nthe President acted in a bipartisan to increase mileage. In 1984 it got \nup to 24.5 miles a gallon. Trucks also went up. The average almost \ndoubled. We almost doubled our mileage because we decided to do so. We \ntook some common-sense measures to increase our mileage.\n  Then in 1985 the Federal Government went to sleep and the Federal \nGovernment refused to take any further action to increase mileage, and \nmileage went down. The average mileage of our total fleet, cars and \ntrucks, had gone down in 1985. Since 1985, we have mapped the human \ngenome, we have invented the Internet and applied it to great usage, \nand yet the mileage manufacturers provide us has gone down since 1985. \nWe can do better than this.\n  I am 6 feet 2 inches, 200 pounds and driving a hybrid car that gets \nin excess of 40 miles a gallon. It is safe, it is comfortable. We can \ndo better.\n  If we inflated our tires to the manufacture recommended level, we \nwould save more gas than we will ever get out of ANWR if we destroy \nthat area through drilling. So there are things that we can do.\n  I want to suggest a solution, and that is we can pass the New Apollo \nEnergy Project, a bill that I have introduced with other Members of the \nHouse. The New Apollo Energy Project will have an aggressive \ntechnologically based way to solve this problem, and it will do that by \nusing what America is great at, which is our creative genius. And the \nreason we call it the New Apollo Energy Project, it is to kindle the \nspirit that we had when John F. Kennedy stood right behind me on May 9, \n1961,\n\n\nand he challenged America to go to the moon in 10 years and return a \nman safely. That was very daring. We had not even invented Tang yet, \nand our rockets were blowing up on the launch pad. But he did it \nbecause President Kennedy understood one thing about the American \ncharacter, he understood that Americans are genius when it comes to \ninnovation, and that Americans love a challenge.\n  We need now a bold vision and a challenge to America to invent our \nway out of this difficulty, to invent the new clean, renewable energy \nsources that can help solve this problem, to invent the new, more \nefficient cars, refrigerators, air conditioning units, building, \nhouses, you name it, in a way to use energy more efficiently.\n  We know if we do that, and the New Apollo Energy Project will do \nthat, we will harness the talent of America to get that done. The \nreason that we are suggesting this is not just global warming, there \nare two things that the New Apollo Energy Project will do.\n  Number one, it will break our addiction to Middle Eastern oil. We \nknow that the energy bill that passed the House, a sordid affair that \ngave 94 percent of $8 billion, 94 percent of the bill that this Chamber \npassed, I voted against, 94 percent of the $8 billion of taxpayer money \nwent as a direct subsidy to the oil and gas industry, to the most \nprofitable industry in America, to an industry that is getting over $60 \na barrel for fuel.\n  Hooking our wagon to the oil and gas industry to try to drill our way \nout of this problem is simply doomed for failure. The reason it is \ndoomed for failure is that the oil is not here, it is elsewhere. We \nonly have 3 percent of the world's oil supply, but we generate 25 \npercent of the world's CO2 production. The oil simply is not \nhere. Dinosaurs went somewhere else to die, actually leafy vegetation \nmaterial. They went mostly to the Mideast, to Venezuela and Indonesia \nand off the coast of Norway, but not here. So we are chasing a losing \nproposition here to try to drill our way out of this problem.\n  Besides, even if it was here, we would be competing with China now \nwith this huge new economy to compete for this new resource. No, this \nis a failure just waiting to happen. So this 94 percent solution is \nmoney that is not going to solve our energy problems.\n  The New Apollo Energy Project, by contrast, will say we do not have \nto think about what the Saudi Royal House thinks about our public \npolicy. When we make a decision on the Middle East, we will be free of \nthat. We will not have to face the prospect of our sons and daughters \ndying in the Middle East again. We have lost enough. Now it is time to \nget serious about this, and an oil and gas driven policy is not a \nserious energy policy, it is a sham.\n  But this New Apollo Energy Project will have a third and very \nimportant benefit. It will grow jobs in this country. You have to ask \nyourself why are we letting the jobs to build fuel efficient cars go to \nJapan. Those cars should be union jobs here in the United States. Why \nare we letting jobs go to Germany for solar cell production, they \nshould be here in the United States.\n  The New Apollo Energy Project is as American as apple pie because it \nmeans American jobs. Two causes for optimism in that regard, and a lot \nof people think when we talk about new energy that somehow it is just \npie in the sky, but they really have not paid attention to look at the \nscience that is going on in new energy.\n  What we find, and these are graphs of the prices of renewable energy \nsystems in the last 30 years or so. What we see is that all of these \nnew technologies have come down in price dramatically. We look at wind \nhere that in 1980 was 30 cents a kilowatt hour, is down to about 4, 5, \n6, and is projected to continue to go down.\n  In my neck of the woods, wind is a huge new growth industry. We are \nputting in North America's largest wind farm in southeast Washington, a \nutility very close to where I live. It is essentially market based in a \nlot of places.\n  We see photovoltaics have gone by a factor of about 5 in the last 30 \nyears, from 100 cents a kilowatt hour down to about 22 now and \nprojected to go further.\n  Biomass has gone from 12 down to 7 or 8; solar thermal has \nexperienced the same thing.\n  What we have found is while oil has been going up, renewables have \nbeen coming down, and renewables are somewhat more expensive today, \nmost of them still, than fossil fuels. But that is not going to last \nlong because China is coming on, and if you have seen what has happened \nto the price of oil, we are going to be in an international bidding war \nwith the Chinese economy, and that price is going to continue to go up. \nWe have something cheaper in these technologies which have become more \ncost based because they have become more efficient, and we use scales \nof economy. Every time we build one of these, the price goes down.\n  Let me show you the house of Mr. and Mrs. Alden Hathaway in Virginia. \nIt was built for about $365,000. A little more expensive than a normal \nhouse, although not much. By using solar panel roof, passive energy, an \nin-ground heat pump, decent design, net energy consumption used by \nfossil fuels is zero. Zero.\n  It is a comfortable home. I have seen it. It would not stand out in \nany neighborhood, a place to be proud of, and has zero energy \nconsumption. And the secret is they have net metering. When the sun is \nshining, and even through clouds it works, certain levels of clouds. It \nfeeds electricity back into the grid and their meter runs backward. You \nsell your energy back to the utility, and they have to pay you for it \nwhen we pass my bill, the New Apollo Energy Project.\n  The point I have is this is real. It is out there today. It is \nhappening. I read in this morning's newspaper about a fellow developing \na senior citizen housing complex with essentially the same technology \nin Thurston County, Washington. This is with us. All this Congress has \nto do is to listen to the science, be optimistic about American \ntechnological development, and have just a little bit of common sense \nto act in a positive way in the future.\n  Unfortunately, it has not done that yet, but I stand tonight to say \nthat with this emerging science, with the clarity that has emerged \nabout the threat of global warming, with our positive view about the \nconfidence we have in America's technological ability, we are going to \nsolve this problem. It is doable, it is achievable. The New Apollo \nEnergy Project will help to do that.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. INSLEE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6196-H6201", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "OUR NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6196", "title": "OUR NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY"}
