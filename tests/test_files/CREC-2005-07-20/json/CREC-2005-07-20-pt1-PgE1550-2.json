Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule, which \nprevents the House\n\n\nfrom considering several very important amendments to the State \nDepartment Authorization Act. Among them is one that I offered that \nwould have made the Navy's Marine One helicopter program subject to \nexisting export control laws--that would also have limited the ability \nof foreign companies working on the Marine One program to sell the \ntechnology used in the President's helicopter to countries like Iran \nand other threats to our national security.\n  Unfortunately, this is a very real possibility. In January, the \nMarine One contract was awarded to a European consortium led by \nFinmeccanica Italy and its British subsidiary, Agusta Westland, and \nonly a month later, both companies appeared at an aerospace tradeshow--\nin Iran. The American president of Finmeccanica's U.S. division \nexplained his company's presence in Iran by saying ``I think they're \nour enemy,'' going on to explain, quote, ``In Europe, they don't call \n[Iran] the enemy''--as if that somehow makes it acceptable to sell them \nour most advanced aerospace technology.\n  The notion that the companies building the president's helicopter, \nworking with sensitive American technology, may be doing business with \na member of what the president himself called the ``Axis of Evil'' \nshould give us all very serious concern. Do we want these companies to \nbe able to easily transfer Marine One technology to Iran or other \ncountries? Because that is a very real possibility given the contract \nthe Navy has signed.\n  Mr. Speaker, few images capture the U.S. Presidency like that of the \nMarine One helicopter landing on the White House lawn, the president \nemerging from under the blades--it is ingrained in our collective \nnational consciousness. Even 7 months after this decision was made, I \nstill find it hard to believe that the next generation of the \npresident's helicopters will be largely built not by American but \nforeign workers, with 36 percent of the work on the Marine One program \nperformed in England and Italy. Indeed, the Navy expects to procure 32 \naircraft, the first seven of which will be constructed almost entirely \nin England. Only the final assembly will be done in the United States. \nThis ought to be a matter of our national pride.\n  While I believe that all of this work should be done in the United \nStates, my amendment would have at least ensured that the work on this \nprogram--funded by the U.S. taxpayer, but done outside the United \nStates--will not fall into the hands of state sponsors of terrorism.\n  To be clear, I have no quarrel with Lockheed-Martin or Bell \nHelicopters, who are partners with Finmeccanica and Agusta Westland in \nthis program. Like Sikorsky, they make many fine products upon which \nour troops rely, and they employ thousands of hard-working men and \nwomen whose love of country is unrivaled. But, Mr. Speaker, the \ndecision to award a large portion of this contract to European \ncompanies is deeply misguided and could have an adverse impact on our \nnational security.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Marine One helicopter is expected to have the most \nadvanced parts, security features, communications equipment and \nsurvivalibity of any rotorcraft in our military's arsenal. And to allow \nthat technology and equipment to fall into the hands of threats to our \nnational security is a risk that none of use should take. Yet that is \nexactly what the House Republican leadership has forced us into doing.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this rule so that the House may have \nthe opportunity to consider this critically important issue.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. DeLAURO", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1550-E1551", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "TITLE", "congress": "109", "number": "2601"}], "doc_title": "PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2601, FOREIGN RELATIONS AUTHORIZATION ACT, FISCAL YEARS 2006 AND 2007", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgE1550-2"}
