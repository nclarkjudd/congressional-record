Mr. Speaker, tonight is an unusual, if not \nunprecedented, special order. It is one that I think that the country \nwill appreciate and I think our colleagues in this Congress will \nappreciate it; one where we have brought at least a half dozen, and \nmore will join us, Members of Congress of both parties to this Chamber \nin opposition to the Central American Free Trade Agreement. I am joined \nby the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones), the gentleman from \nAlabama (Mr. Davis), the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goode), and the \ngentleman from Idaho (Mr. Otter). There are five of us here now two \nDemocrats, three Republicans, and I know a number of Members will join \nus later.\n  We are joined together because we believe the Central American Free \nTrade Agreement is not in the best interests of our Nation. We have \nseen that for a dozen years our trade policy has simply not worked for \nthe American people, it has not worked for rural, family farmers in \nAlabama, it has not worked for workers in Idaho, in Virginia, in North \nCarolina, and in my State of Ohio.\n  Before turning to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones), and \nI think people will just kind of join in a conversation here, I want to \njust point to a series of numbers that really does illustrate why we, \nas Republicans and Democrats, as people that represent small \nmanufacturers and family farmers and family ranchers and labor unions \nand environmentalists and religious leaders, and people of faith and \nall of that, why we oppose it. We can just look at what has happened to \nour country's trade deficit in the last 12 years.\n  The year I ran for Congress the first time in 1992 and was elected, \nwe had in our country a trade deficit of $38 billion. That meant, in \nthose days, a trade deficit of $38 billion meant that we imported $38 \nbillion more than we exported. A dozen years later, our trade deficit \nhas grown to $618 billion; from $38 billion to $618 billion in just a \ndozen years. That translates clearly into lost jobs. It translates into \nlost textile jobs in Mr. Jones' State, it translates in the lost auto \nand steel and other jobs in my State. In the last 5 years alone, we \nhave seen somewhere between 2.5 and 3 million manufacturing jobs lost, \nnot entirely because of trade agreements, but in large part because of \ntrade agreements.\n  That is why all of us say we want to trade with Central America, we \nwant to pass a Central American Free Trade Agreement, but not one that \nis written and negotiated by a select few for a select few. We want a \ntrade agreement that all of us can support, that ranchers and small \nfarmers and environmentalists and labor unions and small manufacturers \nand small businesses, that all of us can come together and support. \nThat is really why we are here tonight as a group of Members of \nCongress from both parties.\n  I would like to turn it over to the gentleman from North Carolina \n(Mr. Jones), who has helped lead this operation in opposition to the \nCAFTA.", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. BROWN of Ohio", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "J000255", "text": "  Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from \nOhio, and I also am delighted to be here in a bipartisan way to do what \nis right for the American people.\n  I want to take just a few minutes to talk about my State of North \nCarolina. We all come from Virginia, from Idaho, from Alabama, from \nOhio, and many other States, and there will be others that will be \ncoming here tonight to speak, as the gentleman from Ohio mentioned. I \ndo not know how America can work unless we come together, and certainly \none of the major issues is trying to save jobs in America.\n  I want to go back very briefly to NAFTA. NAFTA was passed in 1992. I \nwas not here. It was implemented in 1993. In my State of North \nCarolina, because of NAFTA, we have lost over 200,000 manufacturing \njobs. In the Nation we have lost more than 2.5 million jobs. That is \njust because of NAFTA.\n  And what in the world are we going to do with CAFTA? CAFTA is nothing \nbut a cousin to NAFTA, and NAFTA itself is not well. It is kind of like \nsomebody being sick. NAFTA is sick because it has done nothing to help \nAmericans in this country, and it did nothing to help the Mexicans stay \ndown in Mexico and make a good living wage with benefits so they would \nnot want to come across the border. They are coming across the border \nnow between 8,000 and 10,000 a week.\n  I want to also say about CAFTA, you cannot have fair trade if both \ncountries do not benefit. Those people that want to have CAFTA to \nbecome the law of the land, in my opinion, I say to the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Brown), the word is greed. Greed. You cannot help the \nAmerican people unless you treat our workers fairly, help them maintain \ntheir jobs, and not see their jobs sent overseas.\n  Before yielding, I want to show just two charts to my friends here on \nthe floor. This happened in North Carolina in 2003 and it says, \n``Pillowtex Goes Bust, Erasing 6,450 Jobs.'' This happened in one day's \nannouncement, 6,450 jobs lost, gone. The subtitle says, ``Five North \nCarolina Plants Closing in Largest Single Job Loss in State's \nHistory.''\n  I want to share another blow-up of a news article with my friends on \nthe floor. This is from the Wilson Daily Times. This is a county that \nCongressman G.K. Butterfield and I share together, it is a split \ncounty. And it says, this is about 3 months ago, ``VF Jeanswear Closes \nPlant, Last 445 Jobs\n\n\nGone By Next Summer.'' The two ladies down here at the bottom named \nBrenda Webb and Shivan Battle, will not be able to chitchat in the \nparking lot of VF Jeanswear next year when the plant closes. People \nwere actually crying when this announcement was made. They are losing \ntheir jobs and their benefits and their hopes and their dreams.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I want to say to my friends here tonight on the \nfloor that I look forward to working with my colleagues day in and day \nout. If CAFTA does come to the floor, hopefully we will be able to \ndefeat it. We have a strong support of Republicans, probably 25 to 30, \nand I do not think the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown) would bend under \nany circumstances, and I want to thank the gentleman for being the \nleader he has been. I look forward to continuing to work with the \ngentleman, and let us do what is right for America and the American \npeople.", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. JONES of North Carolina", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B000944", "text": "  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding. I thank him for his thoughtfulness and for his leadership on \nthis issue over the better part of a decade now.\n  And I thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones) for his \nbipartisanship and his thoughtful approach.\n  I would say to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown), one of the things \nthat strikes me about this debate is when I tell many people in the \nbusiness community, I tell some of our editorial writers that I am \nfirmly opposed to this agreement, there is a regular refrain that they \nhave. They say to me, Mr. Davis, why are you against globalization? And \nthey say, why are you against trade? And it strikes me that that is \nsuch an enormously false way to frame this argument. To say that \nsomeone is against globalization if they oppose this treaty is a real \nmisstatement of what we are debating and what we will be voting on 1 \nweek from now, and I want to talk about that for a moment.\n  There are some of us in this Chamber who have voted for every trade \nagreement that we have seen since we have been here. I voted for \nagreements with Australia, with Morocco, with Chile, with Singapore. I \nam someone who firmly believes in this modern economy that we cannot \ndisengage ourselves from the rest of the world; and I, by no means, \nsubscribe to the label of being anti-trade or being anti-globalization. \nBut I think that there is another way. There is a possibility if we are \nthoughtful enough and serious enough about this economy and our \nobligations to build a trade policy that actually prods countries \naround this world to change. There is a possibility of building a trade \npolicy that elevates conditions around the world.\n  And I would submit that there are two kinds of trade policies. There \nis one set of policies that challenges the rest of the world to rise to \na higher standard, and there is another set of trade policies that \ntakes the world as it is and does not seek to move, does not seek to \nbend it, does not seek to change it.\n  And I and so many of us believe in the first kind. I believe in a set \nof principles that say that we can use our trade as we occasionally use \nour economic might, as we occasionally use our political might to \nimprove conditions. The reality is that if this agreement is somehow \npassed next week, despite the great opposition to it, it will open up a \nnew low-wage market, and it will say to five countries in Central \nAmerican and to the Dominican Republic that your low-wage conditions, \nyour failure to protect your workers, your failure to protect your \nwomen from discrimination laws, your failure to prevent children from \nworking, is acceptable in the community of nations, it is acceptable in \nthe economic community of nations.\n  And I remember, as the gentleman from Ohio does, when President Bush \ngave his second inaugural just a few months ago. Most of that inaugural \nwas devoted to the proposition that, as a superpower, we have an \nability to change the character of this world. Much of that inaugural \nwas dedicated to the idea that, as a superpower, we have the ability to \nchallenge this world and the most repressive countries in this world to \nmove in a better direction.\n  Here we stand, just 7 months later; and that challenge is not being \nposed to the House, not by the administration. That challenge is not \nbeing posed to us. And all of a sudden the same President who told us 7 \nmonths ago that we have in our power to move this world toward reform, \napparently does not believe that we can do so when it comes to the \ndollars and cents that people earn every day, apparently does not think \nthat we can do so when it comes to the quality of community the people \nlive in every day around the world.\n  There is a very cruel argument that I have heard in the last several \ndays I want to mention to you. I have heard it said that if you do not \nsupport CAFTA that somehow you are not standing by the countries of \nCentral America. I have heard it said that if you do not support CAFTA \nthat you are somehow abandoning these poor miserable nations and that \nyou are somehow leaving them to just be cut adrift.\n  What I do not understand is how we can say that we are standing by \nthe CAFTA countries when we are not standing by millions of children, \n14 million in the whole region who are between 5 and 14 who got up and \nwent to work this morning and who are being put in bed tonight and will \ngo back to work tomorrow morning. I do not understand how we can say \nthat we are somehow standing by Central America when we cannot stand by \nthe rights of women in these countries.\n  I do not understand how we can say that we are standing by Central \nAmerica when we cannot stand for the rights of the voiceless and those \nwho work and want to express their political beliefs or their desire \nfor better conditions in the workplace and can be fired because of \nthose opinions.\n  I do not see how we can say that we are standing by Central America \nwhen we are leaving it unchallenged to change itself. That is what this \ndebate is about. This is about, to use a word that is used on both \nsides of this aisle very freely, this is a debate about values because \nI define values as what we demand from others, what we demand from \nourselves and the vision that we offer to others.\n  This agreement offers such a narrow vision. It offers such a limited \nnotion of what our economy can be. It tells us that we can roll back \nour trade deficit on the backs of unskilled workers around the world. \nIt tells us that we can somehow improve certain industries and the \nprofits of certain industries by diverting them to low-wage economies. \nAnd it somehow says that we can trade off the fortunes of our people \nand the fortunes of other people interchangeably without any higher \nstandard to lift them both.\n  Another point that I want to address, so many of the editorials that \nI have seen on this issue have a certain bloodless quality to them \nbecause they say if you believe in globalization, yes, you have to \naccept that there are winners and losers, and there will be more \nwinners than losers, and the losers simply have to get over it. They \nsimply have to adjust.\n  Well, like the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones), I represent \nsome of the towns in west Alabama that are full of some of the people \nwho will lose, families who today are working in textile companies, \napparel companies, hosiery companies, who may not be able to work there \nif this agreement puts a set of forces in place. And I do not think of \nthose people as being losers. I think of them as being families who are \nstruggling to build a future for their families. I think of them as \nbeing people who want their kids to be able to come back and work in \nwest Alabama. I think of them as being people who desperately want a \nbetter life for themselves and their children and their grandchildren. \nAnd I think that we should keep this in mind as I begin to close today.\n  How do we promote and defend a vision to the American people that \nconcedes that so many of us will be losers?\n\n\n  How do we promote and defend a vision and a set of values that \naccepts that so many of our people will be left to fall behind under \nthe trends of this agreement we set in place, and that so many people \nin Central America will be left in their substandard condition?\n\n  There is no wonder why this agreement is struggling to pass Congress. \nThere is no wonder why, if almost any of us went back to our States, we \nwould find either a mystery or we would find out right confusion around \nCAFTA. The reason the case has not been made is because the American \npeople are tired of being denominated and delineated into winners and \nlosers. They are tired of being told that you may lose, but you have to \nget over it. And that is the final point at stake here today.\n  Can we build a trade vision which offers a better way for so many \nworkers in our country? Because it is not enough to simply say that, \nwell, there are these abstract benefits that are off in the distance. \nWe have to be able to talk to people in the gentleman from Ohio's (Mr. \nBrown) district and my district and the gentleman from Idaho's (Mr. \nOtter) district and the gentleman from North Carolina's (Mr. Jones) \ndistrict and the gentleman from Virginia's (Mr. Goode) district.\n  We have to be able to talk to them and say here is why your Congress \nis doing this. And right now we could not justify it. Right now we \ncould not say to them that these agreements will create a higher \nstandard of living in America or abroad. Right now we could not say \nthat these conditions will meet the American test of reforming the \nworld for the better. We simply cannot make the case. The \nadministration cannot make the case.\n  So in closing I simply call on my colleagues tonight, 1 week from \nnow, or 1 week and 1 day from now when we, in all likelihood, vote on \nthis agreement, to vote on their principles, to vote for trade that has \nvalues lying beneath it, to vote for a vision of how we can reform the \neconomies of the world, and not to accept this limited vision.\n  And I am reminded so often of something that William Jefferson \nClinton who was elected the same year that the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. \nBrown) was to Congress. He often said that he was so tired of what was \ncold blooded being passed off as courageous in politics.\n  I fear that our indifference to the fortunes of the people who live \nin these countries, our failure to prod their governments toward reform \nlooks a lot like that cold bloodedness that President Clinton was \ntalking about. And it is so wrong for the editorial boards, so wrong \nfor so many lobbyists in this city to say that that cold bloodedness is \nreally courage. It is not courageous, and it will not be courageous to \ntake your voter card and to stand on the floor in the well of this \nHouse next week and to vote for an agreement that is so empty and so \nvacant of values.\n  I thank the gentleman from Ohio for his good work. I thank our \nRepublican colleagues who are here tonight for joining us in that \nbipartisan cause and thank them and hope the American people recognize \nthat this is a critical vote, because it is a statement of what kind of \ncommunity we are and how we exist in the international community of \nnations.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. DAVIS of Alabama", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B000944", "text": "  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Davis). \nThe gentleman's comments about when people almost always dismiss us, \nsay why are you against trade, why are you against globalization, I \nthink you made the case very well that we want to increase trade, but \nwe want to do it in a way that lifts people up, those children in \nCentral America who have no real protections, that go to work as \nchildren, not as young adults, but as children, that we could in fact \nuse these trade agreements to improve living standards to respect \nAmerican workers and American farmers and improve living standards in a \ndeveloping world.\n  But this trade agreement, because it was so narrowly constructed, \nwritten by a select few for a select few, obviously falls short. And I \ndream of a day when all of us can vote for a trade agreement, that we \ncan get 350, 400 votes here, a trade agreement that really does lift \nworkers up in the developing world while preserving and enhancing our \nstandard of living and respecting workers in this country. There is \nsimply no reason we cannot do that, as you suggest.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Otter), who has \nsaid particularly interesting things about the issues of sovereignty \nand what that means with both Central American countries and the \nDominican Republic and with the United States.\n  (Mr. OTTER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. BROWN of Ohio", "itemno": 5}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "O000166", "text": "  Mr. OTTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown) for his \nleadership on this effort. It has often been said in the past that all \nthat needs to happen for good government to go bad is for good people \nto do nothing. And I want to congratulate the gentleman on the goodness \nthat he is doing tonight in organizing this effort to bring to the \nAmerican people the full blush and the full pain that CAFTA would \nreally offer us.\n  It has often been said and cheered throughout this world that we live \nin that the United States is the standard of living to be desired by \neveryone, to be cherished by everyone, the standard of living that is \nsecond to none in the world. And I think the gentleman from Alabama's \n(Mr. Davis) remarks relative to some of the globalization efforts that \nare so present in the CAFTA agreement is the one very reason that I am \nagainst it, because this globalization effort is a race to the bottom \nfor the United States.\n  We have nothing to do but lose in this agreement. There is not one \nthing that we can gain because it is, as many have already said before \nme, it is a race to the bottom and it is a replay of NAFTA. And all you \nneed to do is take a look at the chart up front, and I hope the cameras \ncan give that some face time, C-SPAN can give that some face time, \nbecause it is important to look and see exactly what happened after we \nadopted NAFTA.\n  We were told in NAFTA in the early 1990s that we were going to have \nthis tremendous explosion in exports from the United States to Mexico, \nand that we were going to be able to increase, at that time, what was a \npositive trade agreement with Mexico. Well, you can see exactly what \nhas happened, starting in 1995. We continued to drop down, until today \nwe are at roughly 40-some billion dollars in deficit trade with Mexico. \nAnd that is precisely what we are going to see happen with CAFTA.\n  Thomas Jefferson once said that he had but one lamp that illuminates \nhis path into the future and that is the lamp of experience. I have no \nway to judge the future except by the past.\n  Well, if NAFTA is the judge, the measure that we have to judge \nourselves by on our success and what we can expect from CAFTA, I can \ntell you folks, it is not near as bad. It is not near as bad as it is \ngoing to be.\n\n\n  CAFTA has some unique features all of its own. In his introduction, \nthe gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown) mentioned that I had a new twist on \nit relative to sovereignty. I just want every Member of this House, all \n435 Members of this House, I want them to be prepared when they have to \ngo home and explain to their folks at home exactly what they have done, \nfor whatever amount of the 435 Members vote for CAFTA, and quite \nfrankly, in selling down the drain the sovereignty of this country.\n  You see, under our CAFTA agreement, it is interesting that CAFTA is a \npretty good size document. I am not going to lie to everybody and tell \nthem that I have read the entire thing. But I tell you I have read the \ntrade part and that was about 20 pages. The next almost thousand pages \nis international law. And the international law is what is going to \nprevail in any business agreement that we have with these five \n``fledgling democracies'' under the CAFTA trade agreement.\n  Here is what happens. If I happen to sell something to, say, the \nDominican Republic, if I happen to sell something to the Dominican \nRepublic from one of my entrepreneurs in Idaho, and they get into a \nconflict of what the agreement was or in one way or another this has to \nbe settled by a third party, here is exactly what happens under the \nCAFTA rules.\n  The Dominican Republic would submit the name of one arbiter. The \nUnited States would submit the name of one arbiter. And then here is \nthe punch line, one of the other non-involved members of the CAFTA \ntrade\n\n\nagreement gets to submit a third arbiter. So now what we are going to \nhave is two Caribbean Basin members and one United States member \nserving on a court of arbitration in order to solve this problem.\n  Now, if that does not happen what happens? If these folks cannot come \nto an agreement then what happens, if this tribunal cannot solve it? \nThen we go to the World Bank or we go to the United Nations to solve \nwhat is otherwise a business agreement.\n  Now it is interesting that the best place to be in this agreement is \nnot in the United States. We are told constantly that we are going to \nbe opening all of these countries up if we will just pass this trade \nagreement. We are not going to be having the duties and the quotas and \neverything that stops all of our goods from freely being imported into \nthese other countries. Dead wrong.\n  Number one, there are a lot of duties and quotas that will go away \nbut there are still quite a few that are going to last into the next 20 \nyears, so we are still not going to be on a fair and equal trading \nlevel with the other members of CAFTA. But let us take a look at who \nput all of those duties and quotas in place.\n  In 1984 this Congress passed what is called the Caribbean Basin \nInitiative, and we said as long as you add 28 percent of the value to \nwhatever good or whatever value added items that you have in these \nCaribbean Basin countries, you can come into the United States with \nthose products without quotas and without duty and without fees. \nHowever, the United States did not have the same agreement going back, \nand so we have done this to ourselves; and yet now we are saying that \nwe are going to try to clear all this up with CAFTA.\n  I agree with the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown). I agree with the \ngentleman from Alabama (Mr. Davis). I think what we ought to do is go \nback and repeal the Caribbean Basin Initiative and then start from the \nget-go. And then we can say something to them about their environmental \nconcerns, our environmental concerns. Then we can say something to them \nabout the unequal labor laws or labor practices in the relative \ncountries. But as it stands now we simply do not have the opportunity \nto do that.\n  So there is one area that I would like to pay special emphasis to. I \nknow a lot of people have said to me over the last couple of weeks, you \nare way over-concerned about the CAFTA agreement and what it is going \nto do to the sovereignty of the United States.\n  I say this to you, that I have stood here on this floor and I have \nwatched every Member on this side of the House and many Members on the \nother side of the House that have voted against any attempt to take one \nof our warriors that is fighting for freedom in Iraq or Afghanistan or \nany foreign country, and any attempt to put them before any kind of a \ntribunal outside the United States we have resisted and correctly so. \nYet these are the same people, a majority of which now is willing to \noffer up our economic warriors to international tribunals.\n  It seems terribly inconsistent to me that if it is correct to deny \nthe courts, any foreign court to hold judgment over our soldiers, it \nought to be the same way with our trade agreements. But anyway, I would \ndirect everybody's attention to Article 10. Just read Article 10. \nBeyond its plain language we have now got hard evidence how the CAFTA \ntribunal system would work in real life and how it would create real \nadvantages for foreign companies other than the United States, because \na similar system was established in NAFTA and that is the one I would \nlike to draw your attention to.\n  A case was brought under that system in Loewen v. The United States, \nand this has set a legal precedent that should scare us all. In that \ncase a Canadian funeral home conglomerate named Loewen challenged the \njudgment of a Mississippi State court that ruled against it in a \nprivate contract dispute with a Biloxi, Mississippi funeral home. The \nonly government action in question was the normal function of a State \ncourt in a private business dispute.\n  The Canadian company under NAFTA rules claimed that having to follow \nthe standard rules of U.S. Civil Procedure in court, such as posting a \nbond, violated their NAFTA foreign investor rights. And the World Bank \ntribunal in that case ruled that the State court's normal operation was \n``governmental action,'' and therefore regulated by NAFTA and that its \nconduct violated the Canadian conglomerate special NAFTA granted \ninvestor rights. It is just tenfold that bad in CAFTA.\n  So I would hope that if those who are watching, those who are sitting \nat home thinking that their folks in Congress are working in their best \ninterest, I would hope that they would take the opportunity in the next \nweek, which we should be voting on CAFTA next week, to call their \nCongressman and find out why they are voting away the sovereignty of \nthe United States, the Constitution, and especially Article III of the \nUnited States Constitution.\n  Why are they voting to put that into foreigners' hands? Why are they \ntaking away those great precious gifts that our Founding Fathers fought \nso hard for and worked so hard for? And now we seem to be in a rush to \nput once again for whatever reason another trade agreement called CAFTA \nahead of the Constitution of the United States.\n  In closing, I would just say to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown) \nagain that I took a look at that first chart that he had up there that \nshowed we had some $610 billion in trade deficit last year, $610 \nbillion. Let us use the United States Department of Commerce's own \nfigures. The United States Commerce Department constantly touts that \nfor every billion dollars in foreign trade we will create 40,000 jobs. \nSo if you just do simple mathematics and multiply that, you would see \nthat that is 2.5 million jobs that we have lost since the inception of \nNAFTA.\n  I say again, CAFTA is the same song, second verse, just a little bit \nlouder and a whole lot worse.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss another reason for my opposition \nto the Central American Free Agreement or CAFTA. What I would like to \nhighlight today is that CAFTA establishes a double standard--greater \nrights are given to foreign investors operating within the United \nStates than are provided by the U.S. Constitution for our own citizens \nand businesses.\n  The foreign investor protection provisions in CAFTA's Chapter 10 and \nthe establishment of a separate ``court'' system available only to \nforeign investors form the core of this double standard. This aspect of \nCAFTA is called ``investor--state dispute resolution.'' It shifts \ndecisions away from Congress and out of the Federal court system \nestablished by Article III of the Constitution, or even our State court \nsystems, and into the authority of international tribunals--even though \nthe dispute concerns activities and parties operating within the United \nStates! Furthermore--and the U.S. Trade Representative's office is very \ncareful NOT to mention this--CAFTA's Chapter 10 allows investors from \nthe CAFTA nations operating in the United States to challenge U.S. laws \nin U.N. and World Bank tribunals!\n  Here's how it works:\n  CAFTA grants foreign investors from the CAFTA countries operating \nwithin the United States special rights set in international law but \nNOT in U.S. Constitutional law. CAFTA allows these foreign investors to \nuse U.N. and World Bank tribunals to seek payment in U.S. taxpayer \ndollars for the losses caused by complying with the same domestic \npolicies that apply to U.S. citizens and businesses.\n  These special rights are laid out in Article 10 of CAFTA, which \ncontains the rules that will govern investment among parties to the \nagreement. Of key interest is Article 10.5. Here we read that CAFTA has \na Minimum Standard of Treatment for foreign investors set forth by \n``customary international law'' and established in ``principle legal \nsystems of the world.''\n  So once again, the standard of review in these CAFTA Article 10 cases \nis not U.S. law but rather international law set in CAFTA. And \nfurthermore, it is not a U.S. court that hears and settles these \ndisputes occurring within the territory of the United States. Instead \nCAFTA Article 10.16.3 gives jurisdiction over these kind of disputes to \ninternational tribunals established under the auspices of the United \nNations or World Bank!\n  So you have international tribunals judging whether foreign investors \noperating within the United States are being provided the proper rights \nand protections!\n  American investors here at home are not allowed to bring cases before \nthis special CAFTA tribunal system. American companies and investors \nuse the American court system while companies and investors from the \nCentral America use the CAFTA tribunal system.\n\n\nSo CAFTA will give us two separate and unequal systems of justice: One \nfor American investors and companies and another for Central American \ninvestors.\n  Some of my colleagues might say, ``Well, you've shown that there are \ntwo different systems here, but that doesn't mean there is \ninequality.'' Others might say, ``Butch, you're only blowing smoke \nhere,'' or, ``It won't be so bad.'' To all those I say, ``Just read \nArticle 10.'' Beyond its plain language, we have hard evidence of how \nthis CAFTA tribunal system would work in real life and how it would \ncreate a real advantage for foreign companies operating within the \nUnited States.\n  A similar system was established by NAFTA. And a case was brought \nthrough that system, Loewen v. U.S., shows the threat that expansion of \nthis system through CAFTA would entail. In that case, a Canadian \nfuneral home conglomerate named Loewen challenged the judgment of a \nMississippi State court that ruled against it in a private contract \ndispute with a Biloxi funeral home. The only government action in \nquestion was the normal function of a State court in a private business \ndispute. The Canadian company claimed that having to follow the \nstandard rules of U.S. civil procedure--such as the posting of a bond--\nviolated their NAFTA foreign investor rights.\n  The World Bank tribunal in the case ruled that the State court's \nnormal operation was ``government action'' regulated by NAFTA and that \nits conduct violated the Canadian conglomerate's special NAFTA-granted \ninvestor rights! The United States only escaped paying hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to the Canadian firm as a result of an error by a \nbankruptcy lawyer, who reincorporated the failing conglomerate as a \nU.S. corporation. That terminated the company's ``foreign'' investor \nstatus and led to a technical dismissal of the NAFTA claim.\n  Still--and this is the point--the substantive legal precedent has \nbeen established under NAFTA and would be expanded under CAFTA. Foreign \ninvestors don't have to follow the standard rules of U.S. civil \nprocedure while U.S. citizens and companies must! Foreign investors \ndon't have to accept as adequate the normal functions of a domestic \ncourt system, while U.S. citizens and companies do!\n  Even the prospect of such a fundamental change in our jurisprudence \nhas prompted the Conference of State Supreme Court Chief Justices and \nthe National Association of Attorneys General to oppose the so-called \n``investor-state'' system's grant of rights that extend beyond U.S. \nlaw. In fact, Congress specifically included language in the 2002 Fast \nTrack legislation to prevent the recurrence of this NAFTA problem in \nCAFTA. The Fast Track legislation required that future trade pacts \ngrant to foreign investors--and I quote--``no greater substantive \nrights with respect to investment protections than U.S. investors in \nthe United States'' and that. The law also requires that future \nagreements include ``standards for expropriation and compensation for \nexpropriation, consistent with United States legal principles and \npractice'' as well as ``fair and equitable treatment [standards] \nconsistent with United States legal principles and practice. . .''\n  Yet, although some words included in NAFTA's investor protection \nsystem were changed relative to CAFTA's provisions, CAFTA clearly fails \nCongress' test. Even worse, CAFTA goes beyond NAFTA and expands on what \nsorts of U.S. domestic decisions and actions are subject to \ncompensation claims in international tribunals.\n  Here's what that means: When U.S. companies obtain mining, logging or \nother concessions on U.S. Federal lands their rights under U.S. law are \ndetermined in domestic courts. However, CAFTA will enable foreign \ninvestors with the identical contracts to take their disputes with the \nU.S. government to the U.N. and World Bank tribunals.\n  Mr. Speaker, the problems with CAFTA are manifest, and they are not \nby any means restricted to the areas of trade or even the broader \ncontext of economic policy. They would have a profound impact on the \nway Americans understand the rule of law, thereby undermining \nconfidence in our government and our system of justice.

I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown), and I want to \nthank him for his steadfast diligence on this issue. I want to thank \nthe gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones) who spoke previously, the \ngentleman from Idaho (Mr. Otter), and the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. \nDavis) for being here tonight during this hour to address what I think \nis one of the most important issues to come before the 109th Congress.\n  Before we began this special order on CAFTA, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Hunter) and the gentleman from California (Mr. \nCunningham) told about Admiral Stockdale and his heroics during the \nVietnam War. That brought to mind what Admiral Stockdale and Mr. Ross \nPerot were saying in 1992.\n  Though the two major party candidates, Bush and Clinton, were \nsupporters of NAFTA, they said that NAFTA would create a giant sucking \nsound of the jobs going out of this country. And I will have to say on \nthat issue, time has certainly proven Ross Perot and Jim Stockdale \ncorrect. And I only have to tell about the situation in the county \nadjacent to my home county.\n  Martinsville and Henry County had more manufacturing jobs on a per \ncapita basis than any jurisdiction in the Commonwealth of Virginia. \nThat was known as the sweatshirt capital of the world. Tultex \nsweatshirts were all over this country and all over the world. Pluma \nwas another textile manufacture. Sara Lee was there. Those jobs\n\n\nand those companies are all gone. Tultex went out of business. Pluma \nwent out of business.\n  I will never forget the Chamber of Commerce there in Martinsville, in \nHenry County in the early 1990s when my predecessor was there and the \nquestions came about NAFTA. Would the jobs still remain in the United \nStates of America? And the speakers there and the proponent of NAFTA \nsaid, oh, yes, only a few low-end manufacturing jobs will be going to \nMexico.\n\n\n  And Sara Lee had in the thousands, manufacturing jobs in Martinsville \nand Henry County. Those jobs went away pretty fast, and they went \nsouth. There are a few distribution jobs left there with Sara Lee. Our \nunemployment went over 20 percent for a time, fell down to 16 percent \nnot too long ago; and, thankfully, it is slightly above 10 percent now. \nAt least it is heading in the right direction.\n  So to those who say that CAFTA, which as the gentleman from Idaho \n(Mr. Otter) so correctly pointed out is simply a NAFTA cousin, is going \nto bring us a lot of manufacturing jobs and prosperity, I say beware. \nDo not forget those who gave the warnings about NAFTA. When NAFTA was \npassed, they were saying we will be bringing more into this country. \nAnd the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Otter) and the gentleman from Ohio \n(Mr. Brown) have shown us how the trade deficit with Mexico has soared. \nIf we adopt CAFTA, that trade deficit with Nicaragua, El Salvador, \nHonduras, Costa Rica, and the Dominican Republic will be heading in the \nsame direction with NAFTA.\n  Now, I heard proponents of CAFTA say, we have got to get in the \neconomic barrel with those in Central America and Mexico so we can \ncounteract China; let us pass CAFTA so we can counteract the huge trade \ndeficit that we have with China. And I can remember those who spoke \naround this country on behalf of Permanent Normal Trade Relations and \nMost Favored Nation trade status with China, saying how great that was \ngoing to be for the United States and jobs in this country. The trade \ndeficit with China is way over $100 billion and rocking on towards $150 \nbillion.\n  I say the answer to the trade deficit with China is not CAFTA; the \nanswer is let us renegotiate. Let us take a look at PNTR and reevaluate \nthat. Let us attack the problem where it is, not create another \nsituation like NAFTA that could result in even a greater deficit with \nthose countries.\n  I have heard, pass CAFTA because it will help stem the flow of \nillegal immigration from Central America. Well, let me say this. Take a \nlook at NAFTA. Illegal immigration was a problem in the early 1990s, \nbut it is a monstrous problem now. NAFTA has not solved the constant \nflow of illegals across the Mexican border into the United States.\n  So do not be sold off on an argument about passing CAFTA and that \nwill reduce the flow from Central America.\n  I submit that the greater interaction between the entities in South \nAmerica and the United States will result in more illegal immigration, \nnot less; and all we have to do is look at the NAFTA model.\n  Lastly, I want to make a few comments about globalization of our \nworld economy. I believe in trade, but I think trade has to be done \nwith hard-nosed negotiation on the part of the United States with \nindividual countries and with regions of the world. And it has to be \nfocused on trade. You have to focus on individual items. It is nuts and \nbolts work.\n  When we have an agreement like CAFTA, when there is an agreement like \nNAFTA, when there is an agreement like PNTR with China that has a whole \nlot in it besides trade, I say be wary. Some of the richest people in \nthis world are in this country, and some of them are supporters of \nCAFTA. They were supporters of NAFTA and PNTR with China. They say if \nwe have a one-world globalized economy how great it is going to be for \nthe United States.\n  Let me say one thing. We are not gaining in manufacturing in this \ncountry. China is the big gainer of manufacturing in the world. It is \nnot this country. Other countries are rapidly catching up. We are the \npremier country in the world now. We are able to protect our citizens. \nWe are able to give a land of opportunity to so many, the richest \npeople in the world, the Warren Buffets and the Bill Gateses of the \nworld. I salute them for their work and their business acumen. They \nhave done well. That is the American Dream: work hard and this is the \nland of opportunity.\n  Well, let me tell my colleagues what can happen. If we go down this \nglobalized route, which, as the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Otter) said, \nis a rush to the bottom, if the United States is not the premier \ncountry in the world, we will see a lot of persons in this world go \nfrom a Bill Gates or Warren Buffet status to the poor house mighty \nquick if China or Russia or the Arab nations in the Middle East take \nover the number one position in the world.\n  I am thankful the United States is number one. I want us to be always \nnumber one. But these trade agreements do not enhance that status. They \nhurt us. And I ask that when CAFTA comes up that my colleagues vote for \nAmerica and vote ``no'' on CAFTA.", "turn": 10, "speaker": "Mr. GOODE", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B000944", "text": "  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Virginia. \nWhat he said about manufacturing and job loss, I put that and the truth \nhe has spoken about what has happened in the last 10 years next to the \npromises made for CAFTA.\n  I remember from a dozen years ago when President Clinton made this \nsame promise. He said, under NAFTA it will increase employment in this \ncountry, it will create jobs, it will mean we will have more \nmanufacturing and export more goods abroad. And he said it would lift \nup the standard of living in the developing world. President Bush says \nthe same thing, that it will mean more jobs. He has said it on trade \nagreement after trade agreement after trade agreement, as did his \npredecessor: it will mean more jobs, more production and manufacturing \nin this country, more selling jobs overseas and raising the standard of \nliving, in this case in the five Central American countries and the \nDominican Republic.\n  Well, all we have to do, and the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Otter) and \nI were talking about this chart a moment ago, all we have to do is look \nat this chart to realize what they are saying just does not make sense. \nThere is an old Ben Franklin quote where he said, ``The definition of \ninsanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a \ndifferent outcome.'' That is really what our trade policy is. They make \nthe same promises, expecting a different outcome, and continue to get \nthe same kind of failed trade policies and failed results.\n  But look at this chart. The average wage in the United States is \n$38,000. The average wage down in these Central American countries and \nthe Dominican Republic is 6,000; Guatemala, $4,100. The average \nNicaraguan makes $2,300 a year. These trade agreements do nothing to \nlift up their living standard so they will make more money. But under \nthese trade agreements, we hear promises from supporters of CAFTA that \nwe are going to sell more products. Whether it is from Virginia, Idaho, \nor Ohio, we are going to sell more products to these countries.\n  But Nicaraguans are not going to buy cars made in Ohio, and Hondurans \nare not going to buy textiles and apparel from Virginia, and \nGuatemalans are not going to buy lumber from Idaho. These trade \nagreements are not about our selling products to those countries, \nbecause people in those countries do not have enough money to buy \nsoftware from Seattle or steel from West Virginia. These agreements are \nabout outsourcing jobs to Guatemala or exploiting workers in Honduras \nor sending manufacturing to Nicaragua.\n  They are not going to lift those people up because there are no labor \nstandards in this agreement, and they are not going to mean a better \nstandard of living or more exports for the United States simply because \nthese people cannot buy our products. Unless we are trading with a \ncountry that can buy our products, or unless we are doing something to \nraise the standard of living in these countries so that they can buy \nour products, these trade agreements are destined to fail.\n  So we end up doing what the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Otter) spoke \nabout a minute ago, we end up with a trade deficit going from $38 \nbillion in a\n\n\ndozen years to $618 billion and all kinds of job losses. In my State of \nOhio in the last 5 years we have lost 220,000 manufacturing jobs. In \nVirginia and the Carolinas, they have combined to lose almost 300,000 \nmanufacturing jobs. In the great Northwest, Washington, Oregon and \nIdaho, they have lost 100,000 manufacturing jobs.\n  In State after State after State, because of these failed trade \npolicies, because our trading partners are not buying our products, \nbecause these trade agreements are all about moving our companies, our \njobs, outsourcing them to these countries, this trade policy simply is \nnot working.", "turn": 11, "speaker": "Mr. BROWN of Ohio", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "O000166", "text": "  Mr. OTTER. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, I just want to \nsay that the gentleman makes a great point. This is the first time I \nhave seen that chart and had it explained the way the gentleman has \nshown it.\n  In my other life, prior to being elected to the United States \nCongress at the turn of the century, I was the president of a large \ninternational company. In fact, I traveled to, worked in, and in many \ncases built plants, but sold product in 82 foreign countries. In fact, \nI supplied McDonald's restaurants with french fries in those countries \nthroughout the world. They wanted a good french fry, and of course \nIdaho raises a great potato, and so subsequently we would go into these \ncountries.\n  It is interesting the demographics that McDonald's does, just like \nany fast food joint or any business goes through. If you take a look at \nthe chart the gentleman has there, if they were making the minimum wage \nat a 40-hour week, at let us say the Federal minimum wage, they would \nbe making, my quick math here, they would be making about $10,480 a \nyear. That is a 40-hour week, 52 weeks a year, and they would be making \nabout $10,480 a year. The highest income, family income, average in \nCosta Rica, comes to $9,000, if I can read that from here.

I thank the gentleman for that. But more interesting than \nthat, more interesting than that, my colleague, is that the $9,000 that \nthose folks make in Costa Rica is half of what our United States \nGovernment says is the poverty level for a family of four, which is \n$18,000. We say if you make $18,000 or less in this country, you do not \nhave to pay any taxes. You are at the poverty level and so we are not \ngoing to put any more burdens on you. Yet they expect these people to \nsuddenly rush in and buy french fries at 50 cents a pound, beef steak \nat $3 or $4 a pound. And so who are they kidding? Who are they kidding \nwhen they say we are going to have these billions of dollars' worth of \nnew exports that are going to be going to these countries?\n  The other thing I wanted to point out is that it is interesting how \nwe constantly shift the paradigm on why CAFTA is so important. \nInitially, of course, and when you are talking to an old businessman \nand an old international grocery salesman like myself, and you tell me \nthat we have some opportunity here to build trade, I am all for it. So \nI say, well, show me the numbers. Show me the numbers, like McDonald's \nused to. They would go in and take a look at the net disposable income, \nand they would say we cannot afford to build a McDonald's down here, in \none of these countries, because who could buy our product?\n  Who can go in there and buy a hamburger, two all-beef patties, \nspecial sauce, onions, lettuce, pickles, cheese on a sesame seed bun, \nplus french fries, and a diet Pepsi or Coke or whatever else they would \nbe selling? Because you see, quite frankly, there is no one in that \ncountry at that average wage that would have the net disposable income \nto do it.\n  So when the trade agreement did not work, suddenly we shifted the \nparadigm to political. We have to do this for these five countries down \nthere, because if we do not, they will go down the drain to communism. \nThey will go down the drain to Fidel Castro and to Hugo Chavez from \nVenezuela, and Ortega is going to take over again, and these other \nfolks are all going to be taking over. So we absolutely have to allow \nthese countries to do this.\n  Well, now, did we not start this in 1984, and have we not given them \nevery economic benefit? And if this is as far as we have gotten since \n1984, in 20, 21 years, I am a little concerned that if this is as far \nas we have gotten, we are not going anywhere with CAFTA.\n  So finally, when the political argument did not work, now they have \nshifted it to immigration. And my good friend, the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Goode), said it very succinctly, and that is that that is \nthe exact same thing they told us with NAFTA.\n\n\n  They said if we just pass NAFTA, we will stop all of this illegal \nimmigration, all of this desire for these folks to come from Mexico \ninto the United States.\n  Well, it is estimated before we passed NAFTA we had something like \n800,000 illegal aliens in the United States, and now it is estimated we \nhave something like 10 million illegal aliens in the United States. \nWell, it sure worked for NAFTA, and I have no doubt in my mind NAFTA \nplus CAFTA equals SHAFTA.\n  I hope that this House is smart enough to turn back this effort to \nsell our sovereignty down the drain for some questionable promises of \neither economic increases for us in trade, political stability in that \npart of the world, or finally reduced immigration problems that we have \nat home.\n  I think that is a very important chart.

Mr. Speaker, the gentleman talks about stability \nof those governments. I have heard the whole series of arguments. It \nwas not much different with NAFTA. The President started off telling us \nNAFTA would be great for businesses, workers, and small manufacturing. \nPeople just were not buying it. Then he shifted it into a national \nsecurity argument and an immigration argument, and then whether it was \nNAFTA or CAFTA, the President, whoever the President was in each one of \nthose, would shift into the old issue of stability of those \ngovernments. President Clinton said it with NAFTA and Mexico. Now they \nare talking about political stability in the Dominican Republic and in \nthe five Central American nations, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, \nCosta Rica, and in Honduras.\n  But when we talk about stability, the opposition to these agreements \nin these countries is widespread and strong. There were all kind of \ndemonstrations. There have been at least 45 demonstrations in the five \nCentral American countries with 150,000 people at least participating \nin those demonstrations, and these are farmers and small business \nowners and workers and ranchers and people who came from the \ncountryside, hiked into the cities and protested at their legislatures.\n  In one of the five Central American countries when the agreement \npassed, they did it in the middle of the night. The legislature met, \nthey had to surround the building and nobody knew about it. All of \nthose kinds of things have happened.

Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons that Idaho is so firm \nagainst CAFTA, and I have received phone calls from companies in Idaho \nthat say we need you to support CAFTA. Absolutely I have. I am not \ngoing to try to kid anybody and say I have not. I have had some phone \ncalls from folks in the agricultural business that tell me that they \nbought into some of those arguments.\n  But for the most part the commodity groups in Idaho are supporting \neach other. And they have said yes, CAFTA may be good for us, but we \nremember when we asked the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Otter) and the \ngentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson) and everybody to vote against the \nAustralian trade agreement because it was bad for the dairy industry \nand it was not too handsome for the beef industry. And so now the beef \nfolks and the dairy folks are remembering that the sugar beet folks and \nthe other farm commodities in Idaho supported them.\n  But all I need to do when they call me and say we want you to support \nCAFTA, I just need to remind them where we were in the early 1990s \nbefore NAFTA. Since NAFTA in my congressional district alone, since \nNAFTA passed, we have lost 32 sawmills, lumber mills in the State of \nIdaho. You do not just lose a lumber bill. The people of Clearwater \nCounty, Idaho, in a little town called Pierce, had a plywood mill that \nthey had to close down as a result of not being able to compete with \nthe Canadian lumber, and not having a softwood agreement with Canada. \nAs a result, they had to shut down the mill.\n  That went on in many little towns. In the town of Cascade, Idaho; \nCouncil, Idaho, it worked its way south in my district, just inside the \nContinental Divide. We eventually shut down over 30 lumber mills and we \nlaid off 14,000 families. Those 14,000 families no longer had an \neconomic future in their business. Some of them were four and five \ngenerations in Idaho. The great Boise Cascade Company no longer has an \noperating unit in the State of Idaho and with the exception of maybe \none or two scattered around in the south of the United States, no \nlonger has an operating mill.\n  When those 14,000 families lost their jobs, school districts started \nto die because the property values of their homes went down because the \nmain employer in the town closed up the mill and left. So there were no \njobs, and so suddenly the equity that they had been building up in \ntheir house, and maybe it was two or three generations, suddenly that \nequity vanished just like the sawmill did, just like their hope for an \neconomic future in the State of Idaho.\n  So you do not just lose a job in a State like Idaho and in a town \nlike Pierce, Idaho, in Clearwater County, or Cascade, Idaho, in Valley \nCounty, or Council, Idaho, in Adams County, you lose school districts \nand you lose property tax base and you lose people. Eventually you lose \nfamilies. That is what it cost the State of Idaho.
