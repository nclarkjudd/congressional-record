Mr. Speaker, this communication is \nforwarded on behalf of the constituents of Congressional District Three \nand myself as we pay tribute to the life of Irene Lockett.\n  We are all deeply and profoundly saddened by the loss of this gentle \nand loving spirit. Irene was a true believer in God and family. She \nencouraged us to be our very best in all we do, at all times. \nThroughout her life, her loving spirit was unshakeable, her will \nundaunted, her stature in the church she loved and in the community she \ncherished remained strong and led Pat, her daughter, and my sister, to \npledge her life to public service. She was the wife of Walter Lockett, \nmother of Pat Lockett-Felder, a member of the Jacksonville, Florida \nCity Council, a grandmother, a great-grandmother and a Matriarch to \nall, family and friends alike. She absorbed our fears and our tears \nwith her gentle embrace. When I think of Irene Lockett, I am reminded \nof the words of Paul in the Book of 2nd Timothy, ``For I am now ready \nto be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a \ngood fight, I have finished my course, I have kept my faith''.\n  Though our hearts ache, our tears of pain are mixed with loving \nmemories of her smile, her touch, and that gleam in her eyes telling \neach of us how much she loved us, even when words would not flow. She \nkept her promise--to love us, nurture us, guide us, and in her own way, \nshe prepared us for this day. Weep not in mournful pain, shed tears of \njoy for Irene--no more pain, no more hurt--rest now in the arms of the \nFather who welcomes her home and whispers gently, ``well done my \nchild''.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1547", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "CONGRESSIONAL COMMENDATION FOR THE LIFE OF MRS.
