Mr. Speaker, last night, the President of the \nUnited States nominated Judge John Roberts, Jr. to be the next \nAssociate Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States. I applaud \nhis choice, and I am hopeful that he is confirmed before the Supreme \nCourt begins its term on October 3.\n\n\n  Judge John Roberts has the keen intellect, the impartiality and \ntemperament, sound legal judgment, and highest integrity necessary for \na Supreme Court Justice. He rules based on the application of existing \nlaws and specific facts of the cases before him, rather than making new \nlaws or creating new policies based on personal opinion.\n  It is not surprising that the National Journal has said of John \nRoberts that he seems to be a good bet to be the kind of judge we \nshould all want to have; all of us, that is, who are looking less for \ncongenial ideologues than for professionals committed to the impartial \napplication of the law.\n  But Judge Roberts is not new to the confirmation process. In fact, he \nwas reported favorably out of the Senate Judiciary Committee by a vote \nof 16 to 3, and then confirmed by the Senate for the D.C. Circuit Court \nof Appeals by unanimous consent. Clearly, Judge Roberts will make an \nexcellent jurist, and I urge the Senate to move quickly with the \nconfirmation process.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6175-H6176", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "JUDGE JOHN ROBERTS: EXCELLENT CHOICE", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6175-6", "title": "JUDGE JOHN ROBERTS: EXCELLENT CHOICE"}
