Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Brenda E. \nPillors on behalf of Ms. Fredette West.\n  Mr. Speaker, on June 12, 2005, God's whisper to ``come home'' came to \nBrenda Pillors (Chief of Staff to Congressman Ed Towns), our sister in \nservice and life on the frontlines in the battles and opportunities to \nimprove life and health for all.\n  It is with honor that I present this special tribute in memory of our \noutstanding colleague and dear friend, Brenda. Today, July 20th marks \nwhat would have been a celebration of Brenda's earthly birthday. \nColleagues, family and friends know that Brenda did so much to improve \nthe quality of life for all people.\n  Brenda developed health policy and legislation that positively \nimpacted public health domestically and internationally. Her expertise \nand outstanding contributions abound in the area of eliminating health \ndisparities among communities of color, women and children, as well as \nthe indigent and marginalized in society. She tirelessly worked on a \nbroad range of social policy issues including Medicare and Medicaid, \nhealthcare reform, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, obesity, sickle cell disease, \ncancer, heart disease, clinical life trials, bioengineering, health \ntechnology, alternative medicine, behavioral health, workforce \ndiversity, and affirmative action. Likewise, she worked collaboratively \nwith various health commissions, agencies, advisory councils, and \nprograms including NIH, FDA, SAMHSA, CDC, HRSA, AHRQ, OMH, OCR, 10M, \nand the National Health Service Corps.\n  Brenda Pillors was always present to advocate on a range of public \nhealth issues from pharmacology, immunology, vaccines, hospitals and \ncommunity health centers, men's health, environmental health, \nnutrition, birth defects, the uninsured and underinsured, to urban and \nrural health, infant mortality, head start, mental health, primary care \npractitioners and community health workers, researchers, private and \npublic sector officials, and on behalf of everyday citizens like you \nand me. Her presence and tremendous heart still have far-reaching \nimpact.\n  We will always remember you Brenda. Your dedication, commitment, \nleadership, expertise, understanding, voice, smile, and laughter will \nforever live in our hearts. Brenda Pillors was a true leader in the \narea of public service and an exemplary servant in God's army of love.\n  My ``sister'' we'll miss you always. Your legacy of achievements is \nwritten in the hearts of those you touched. Your presence and legacy is \nembedded in the walls and along the halls of the U.S. Congress, and is \nalso written throughout the Congressional Record and in legislation, \nCongressional hearing questions, transcripts, committee, conference, \nand agency reports.\n  Brenda truly lived a purpose driven life. Thousands of lives have \nbeen improved and saved because of her life's works. The majority of \nthe people who have and will benefit from her work will never know her. \nThe lives and bright futures of generations to come will benefit from \nher work. We have always been proud of Brenda.\n  Dear Brenda, we thank, salute, and honor you. Our ``sister in \nservice'' who endeavored throughout her life to ensure justice and \nequality for all--Brenda Pillors, PhD.\n  Mr. Speaker, on this day that would have marked Brenda's 53rd \nbirthday we reflect on our love, appreciation and respect for Brenda \nPillors. We thank God and her family for sharing her with the nation, \nthe world and us.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. TOWNS", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1551", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "IN MEMORY OF BRENDA E.
