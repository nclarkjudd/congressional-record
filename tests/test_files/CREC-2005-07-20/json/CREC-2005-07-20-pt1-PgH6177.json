Mr. Speaker, today I have introduced the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty Commitments Act. It calls on the Bush \nadministration to keep America's word, to live up to the agreements we \nhave made to reduce our arsenal of nuclear weapons.\n  The Cold War has been over for about 15 years. I can accept, although \nI disagree, with the argument that an aggressive nuclear arms race \nmight have been the right approach in a bipolar standoff between rival \nsuperpowers, but at a time when our greatest threat comes from \nstateless terrorists there are smarter ways to protect America.\n  Mr. Speaker, 33 years after the United States signed onto the \nNonproliferation Treaty, or NPT, our government is actively seeking to \nundermine it. Last year, for example, the Bush administration sought \n$70 million for a new and completely unnecessary nuclear weapon, the \nRobust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, commonly known as the ``bunker \nbuster.''\n  Mr. Speaker, the United States of America already possesses 10,000 \nnuclear weapons. We already spend $6 billion annually on nuclear weapon \nactivities, activities which represent a substantial increase over Cold \nWar era expenditures.\n  Do we really need to spend more money on weapons that will make the \nworld more dangerous while ignoring other national security priorities, \nthumbing our nose at international law, and losing global credibility \nin the process? Why is it that this administration is enthusiastic \nabout leading a global military coalition to occupy and invade a \nsovereign nation, but reluctant to show global leadership on important \ninitiatives for peace?\n  The potential nuclear capabilities of Iran and North Korea are \nlegitimate threats and we ought to be engaged diplomatically to keep \nthese nations from developing a nuclear program, but what moral \nauthority do we have to apply that kind of pressure if we will not \nagree to even a modest drawdown of our own nuclear weapons?\n  Now the administration has reached an agreement that will allow India \ngreater access to nuclear technologies. This is a terrible policy. \nWhile India is not Iran or North Korea in terms of its threat to \nAmerican security, we are talking about a nation that never signed the \nNPT, has a history of nuclear detonation, and whose border with \nPakistan represents the world's most dangerous nuclear flashpoint. \nThere has to be a smarter way, Madam Speaker, and there is.\n  I have proposed a new approach to national security. I call it SMART \nSecurity. SMART stands for Sensible Multilateral American Response to \nTerrorism. SMART calls on the United States to lead by example, to \nhonor its treaties and meet its nonproliferation obligations. SMART \nwould enhance and expand the cooperative threat reduction program which \nhas led to the dismantling of nuclear weapons and materials in the \nformer Soviet Union.\n  SMART has also held that military forces should be the last possible \nresort preventing war, not preemptive war. It calls on us to fight \nterrorism and weapons of proliferation with strong global alliances, \nimproved intelligence capabilities and vigorous inspection regimes.\n  SMART includes an ambitious international development program to \ncombat the poverty and hopelessness that give rise to terrorism in the \nfirst place, and it diverts resources from Cold War weapons systems to \npriorities like homeland security and energy independence, which are \nmore relevant to current national security threats.\n  There is some irony in the administration's nonproliferation policy. \nThink about it. We have sacrificed nearly 2,000 American lives, \nthousands of our troops have been seriously wounded, and hundreds of \nbillions of dollars to end an Iraqi nuclear threat that did not even \nexist. And as part of a misleading campaign to convince the Nation that \nthere actually was an Iraqi nuclear threat, it appears government \nofficials were even willing to compromise national security by blowing \nthe cover of a CIA agent.\n  Meanwhile, genuine nuclear threats are going dangerously unaddressed, \nand our own government continues to pursue a large and expensive \nnuclear arsenal.\n  We need a SMART approach. We need a complete reassessment of our \nnonproliferation strategy and our national security priorities, \nsomething that will not happen overnight. In the meantime, however, I \nurge my colleagues to join me in support of the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty Commitment Act. At the very least, we can set \nan example by keeping the promises we have already made.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Ms. WOOLSEY", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6177", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "SMART SECURITY AND NPT REINTRODUCTION", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6177", "title": "SMART SECURITY AND NPT REINTRODUCTION"}
