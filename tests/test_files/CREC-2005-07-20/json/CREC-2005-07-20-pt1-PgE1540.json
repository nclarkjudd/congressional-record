JOHN CONYERS, JR.\n\n                              of michigan\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                        Wednesday, July 20, 2005\n\n  Mr. CONYERS, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce the Medical \nMalpractice Insurance and Litigation Reform Act of 2005. In response to \nthe issue of frivolous lawsuits, Title I of the bill provides for a \nseries of measures designed to insure that the lawsuit itself is not \nfrivolous and that the pleadings filed in connection with the suit are \naccurate and meritorious. Title I also provides for alternative dispute \nresolution designed to encourage resolution of medical malpractice \nactions outside of court.\n  The bill also responds to the real problems in the medical \nmalpractice insurance market, namely higher prices driven by lack of \ncompetition and investment losses by insurers leading to a boom/bust \ncycle. In response to these issues, Title II insures that the antitrust \nlaws apply to medical malpractice insurers, price comparisons can be \neasily obtained, and procedural checks are in place to insure that \npremium increases are warranted and can be challenged by health care \nproviders.\n  Above and beyond these requirements, Title III of the legislation \nresponds to concerns that medical malpractice is not available in \ncertain parts of the country. As a result, this title would create \nmonetary grants dispensed through the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration to health care providers who choose to work in \ngeographic areas with a shortage of one or more types of health \nproviders.\n  In addition, the bill responds to the need to fully examine the \nrecent and dramatic increases in medical malpractice insurance \npremiums. Title IV creates an Independent Advisory Commission on \nMedical Malpractice Insurance to evaluate the cause of the recent \npremium increase. Title V authorizes the Department of Health and Human \nServices to collect the data necessary to examine the medical \nmalpractice insurance industry. The following is a more detailed \ndescription of the legislation:\n\n ``The Medical Malpractice and Insurance Reform Act of 2005'' Section-\n                          by-Section Analysis\n\n       Scope. The legislation narrowly defines ``medical \n     malpractice action'' to cover ``licensed physicians and \n     health professionals'' for only cases involving medical \n     malpractice. These definitions are intended to include \n     doctors, hospitals, nurses, and other health professionals \n     who pay medical malpractice insurance premiums. See, Sec. \n     107(8).\n       The Republican legislation is broadly drafted to include \n     HMOs, insurance companies, nursing homes, and drug and device \n     manufacturers for a broad range of liabilities including \n     suits by physicians against those companies. The full extent \n     to which H.R. 534 protects the wrongdoings of these companies \n     is still unknown.\n\n\n                  Title I--Reducing Frivolous Lawsuits\n\n       Sec. 101--Statute of Limitations. This section limits the \n     amount of time during which a patient can file a medical \n     malpractice action to the later of three years from the date \n     of injury or three years from the date the patient discovers \n     (or through the use of reasonable diligence should have \n     discovered) the injury. Children under the age of 18 have the \n     later of three years from their eighteenth birthday or three \n     years from the date the patient discovers (or through the use \n     of reasonable diligence should have discovered) the injury.\n       The Republican legislation limits it to the earlier of \n     three years from the date an injury ``manifests'' itself or \n     one year from the date discovered, but in no event can it \n     exceed three years. This makes it more akin to a statute of \n     repose than a statute of limitations. H.R. 534 also \n     establishes a statute of repose for children injured under \n     the age of six that is the later of three years from the date \n     of manifestation or prior to the minor's eighth birthday.\n       Sec. 102--Health Care Specialist Affidavit. This section \n     requires an affidavit by a qualified specialist before any \n     medical malpractice action may be filed. An extension may be \n     granted for such an affidavit if at the time the claim is \n     brought, the claimant has not been able to obtain medical \n     records or other information necessary for the affidavit. A \n     ``Qualified Specialist'' is a health care professional with \n     knowledge of the relevant facts of the case, expertise in the \n     specific area of practice, and in the case of an action \n     against a physician, board certification in a speciality \n     relating to the area of practice.\n       Although the Republicans claim their legislation would \n     limit frivolous claims, H.R. 534 does nothing to ensure that \n     the claims filed by plaintiffs are legitimate. H.R. 534 has \n     no certification process prior to the filing of a medical \n     malpractice lawsuit. H.R. 534 only restricts the rights of \n     injured patients and physicians in meritorious lawsuits.\n       Sec. 103--Sanctions for Frivolous Actions and Pleadings. \n     This section reduces the frivolous lawsuits by requiring that \n     every document in a medical malpractice action be signed by \n     at least one attorney of record. Any unsigned paper is \n     stricken. Second, all plaintiff attorneys who file a medical \n     malpractice action are required to certify that the case is \n     meritorious. Attorneys who erroneously file such a \n     certificate are subject to strict civil penalties. First time \n     violators, the court shall require the attorney to pay costs \n     and attorneys fees or administer other appropriate sanctions. \n     Second time violators, the court shall also require the \n     attorney to pay a monetary fine. Third time violators, the \n     court shall also refer the attorney to the appropriate State \n     bar association for disciplinary proceedings.\n       The Republican legislation does not have a provision that \n     directly addresses the filing of frivolous lawsuits. H.R. 534 \n     only restricts the rights of injured patients and physicians \n     in meritorious lawsuits.\n       Sec. 104--Mandatory Mediation. This section establishes a \n     mandatory alternative dispute resolution (ADR) system for \n     medical malpractice cases. Participation in mediation shall \n     be in lieu of any other ADR method required by law or by \n     contractual arrangements by the parties. States also have the \n     option to allow arbitration. Any party dissatisfied with the \n     result reached through ADR will not be bound by this result \n     and all statements, offers and communication made as part of \n     ADR would be inadmissible as part of an adjudication. A \n     similar approach is recommended by the Committee for Economic \n     Development (CED), which suggests that defendants make and \n     victims accept ``early offers.'' The effect of the ``early \n     offer'' program, according to the CED, is that defendants \n     will reduce the likelihood of incurring litigation costs, and \n     victims would obtain fair compensation without the delay, \n     expense, or trauma of litigation.\n       The Republican legislation does not address alternative \n     dispute resolution methods to reduce the number of medical \n     malpractice actions that are litigated. The sole remedy of \n     the Republican legislation is tort reform that will restrict \n     the rights of those who have been legitimately wronged.\n       Sec. 105--Punitive Damages. This section limits the \n     circumstances under which a claimant can seek punitive \n     damages in a medical malpractice action. It also allocates \n     50% of any punitive damages that are awarded to a trust fund \n     managed by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) \n     through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The \n     money in the trust fund must be used for activities that \n     reduce medial errors and improve patient safety. The \n     Secretary will promulgate regulations that will establish \n     programs and procedures to carry out this objective. See \n     also, Sec. 221-223.\n       The Republican legislation raises the evidentiary standard, \n     provides an exemption for FDA approved drugs or devices, and \n     caps punitive damages at the greater of twice the economic \n     damages or $250,000.\n       Sec. 106--Reduction in Premiums. This section requires \n     medical malpractice insurance companies to annually project \n     the savings that will result from Title I of the bill. \n     Insurance companies must then develop and implement a plan to \n     annually dedicate at least 50% of those savings to reduce the \n     insurance premiums that medical professionals pay. Insurance \n     companies must report these activities to HHS annually. The \n     section provides for civil penalties for the noncompliance of \n     insurance companies.\n\n\n             Title II--Medical Malpractice Insurance Reform\n\n       Sec. 201--Prohibition on Anti-competitive Activities by \n     Medical Malpractice Insurers. This section would repeal \n     McCarran-Ferguson Act to ensure that insurers do not engage \n     in price fixing. The Act, enacted in 1945, exempts all anti-\n     competitive insurance industry practices, except boycotts, \n     from the Federal antitrust laws. Over the years, uneven \n     oversight of the insurance industry by the States, coupled \n     with no possibility of Federal antitrust enforcement, have \n     created an environment that fosters a wide range of anti-\n     competitive practices.\n       Sec. 202--Medical Malpractice Insurance Price Comparison. \n     This section creates an internet site at which health care \n     providers could obtain the price charged for the type of \n     coverage the provider seeks from any malpractice insurer \n     licensed in the doctor's\n\n\n     state. This section specifies the availability of online \n     forms and that all information will remain confidential.\n       The Republican bill does nothing to address the flaws \n     apparent in the medical malpractice insurance marketplace and \n     the regulation of that market. The sole remedy of the \n     Republican legislation is tort reform that will restrict the \n     rights of those who have been legitimately wronged.\n       Sec. 203--Procedural Requirements for Proposed Rate \n     Increases. This section allows any health care professional \n     to challenge a proposed rate increase of medical malpractice \n     insurance in a State administrative proceeding. It also \n     requires that before it implements any rate increase, an \n     insurance provider submit to the appropriate state agency a \n     description of and justification for the rate increase.\n\n\n Title III--Enhancing Patient Access to Care Through Direct Assistance\n\n       Sec. 301--Grants and Contracts Regarding Health Provider \n     Shortages. This section authorizes the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services to award grants or contracts through the \n     Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to health \n     care providers who choose to work in geographic areas that \n     have a shortage of one or more types of health providers as a \n     result of dramatic increases in malpractice insurance \n     premiums.\n       Sec. 302--Health Professional Assignments to Trauma \n     Centers. This section amends the Public Health Service Act to \n     authorize the Secretary to send physicians from the National \n     Health Service Corps to trauma centers that are in danger of \n     closing (or losing their trauma center status) due to \n     dramatic increases in malpractice premiums.\n       The Republican legislation does not directly address the \n     access to care issue caused by rising malpractice premiums. \n     The sole remedy of the Republican legislation is tort reform \n     that will restrict the rights of those who have been \n     legitimately wronged.\n\n\n   Title IV--Independent Advisory Commission on Medical Malpractice \n                               Insurance\n\n       Sec. 401-402--Independent Advisory Commission on Medical \n     Malpractice Insurance. This section establishes the national \n     Independent Advisory Commission on Medical Malpractice \n     Insurance. The Commission must evaluate the causes and scope \n     of the recent and dramatic increases in medical malpractice \n     insurance premiums, formulate additional proposals to reduce \n     those premiums, and make recommendations to avoid any such \n     increases in the future. In formulating its proposals, the \n     Commission must, at a minimum, consider a variety of \n     enumerated factors.\n       The Republican legislation only addresses tort reform and \n     does not examine other causes of malpractice premium costs.\n       Sec. 403--Report. This section requires the Commission to \n     file an initial report with Congress within 180 days of \n     enactment and to file annual reports until the Commission \n     terminates.\n       Sec. 404--Membership. This section specifically establishes \n     the number and type of commissioners that the Comptroller \n     General of the United States must appoint to the Commission. \n     Generally, the membership of the Commission will include \n     individuals with national recognition for their expertise in \n     health finance and economics, actuarial science, medical \n     malpractice insurance, insurance regulation, health care law, \n     health care policy, health care access, allopathic and \n     osteopathic physicians, other providers of health care \n     services, patient advocacy, and other related fields, who \n     provide a mix of different professionals, broad geographic \n     representations, and a balance between urban and rural \n     representatives. Members of the commission will be appointed \n     for three year staggered terms.\n       Sec. 405--Director and Staff, Experts and Consultants. This \n     section allows the Commission to hire personnel and contract \n     services necessary to perform its duties.\n       Sec. 406--Powers. This section allows the Commission to \n     secure from any department or agency information necessary to \n     carry out its purpose. It also requires that the Commission \n     be subject to a periodic audit by the Comptroller General.\n       Sec. 407--Authorization of Appropriations. This section \n     authorizes that such sums be appropriated to the Commission \n     for five fiscal years.\n\n\n   Title V--Medical Malpractice Insurance Information Administration\n\n       Sec. 501--Establishment. This section creates within the \n     Department of Health and Human Services an administration \n     that will collect and evaluate information on the medical \n     malpractice insurance market. Such information includes the \n     frequency of medical malpractice claims paid, the severity of \n     such claims, the portion of claims paid as settlements, the \n     portion of claims paid as a result of a trial, and the \n     division in claims between economic and non-economic damages. \n     The section also requires that insurance companies submit the \n     above data to the administration. The administrator may \n     compel submittal and there will be a civil money penalty for \n     not submitting the data.\n       Sec. 502--Authorization of Appropriations. This section \n     authorizes appropriations for the administration.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1540-E1541", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "109", "number": "534"}], "doc_title": "MEDICAL MALPRACTICE AND INSURANCE REFORM ACT OF 2005", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgE1540"}
