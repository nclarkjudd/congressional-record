Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues have recently \nunveiled a new plan to carve out private accounts from the surplus of \nthe Social Security trust fund. This is the same trust fund that \nPresident Bush said was nonexistent just a few months ago. The \nPresident traveled with great fanfare to West Virginia where he said, \nThere is no Social Security trust fund, just a bunch of IOUs stacked in \nan old filing cabinet.\n  Let me tell the Members something. That old filing cabinet was a new \nfiling cabinet before it got $639 billion taken out of it; and before \nthe year is up, it will be $800 billion that was taken out of the \nSocial Security surplus used for anything but Social Security. That is \nthe problem.\n  And now it seems that the Republicans in Congress have come to a \nstalemate. The President wants to privatize Social Security and cut \nbenefits for the middle class. The congressional Republican leadership \nwould rather avoid benefit cuts, but they too want to privatize Social \nSecurity.\n  While the White House and congressional Republicans struggle to \ndecide which privatization plan they want to be for, I suggest a \ntotally different approach to Social Security: save Social Security \nfirst. The surplus should have been for Social Security. It should \nalways be for Social Security. And my suggestion is on the $800 billion \nthey already took out of it, before they do anything else with some \ngrand plan to cut benefits or privatize it, pay back the $800 billion \nthey took.\n  I worked in an administration where we cut taxes for the middle \nclass, balanced the budget, and extended the life of the trust fund by \n10 years. Why? Because we had an economic plan that worked. It grew the \neconomy. It grew middle-class incomes. It helped homeownership. It \nreduced the poverty rate, and we added 10 years to the life of the \nSocial Security trust fund, and we cut taxes for the middle class, and \nwe balanced the budget, unlike the $2 trillion of additional debt we \nhave added on to the books and on to the shoulders of our children. But \nit requires leadership and priorities, which is in short supply around \nhere.\n  Before we create any private accounts or do anything else to \nfundamentally alter the character and nature of Social Security, our \ntask here is to strengthen Social Security for the future and guarantee \nits future. And none of the plans, none of the various privatization \nplans, none of the ideas of benefit cuts or raising the age, none of \nthat adds to the solvency. And the task here, Mr. Speaker, is to \nstrengthen Social Security.\n  The American people have rejected the President's plan. They have \nrejected the congressional plan. They have rejected anything to do with \nprivatization because they know it is the wrong way. I am going to tell \nthe Members something as a person who represents a lot of employees \nfrom United Airlines: folks like the security that comes with Social \nSecurity.\n  They have had it up to here with risk, and all they are providing \nwith privatization is more risk on top of more risk. They have it in \ntheir health care. They have it in their jobs. They have it in their \nown retirement savings. They do not need more risk, and they like the \nfoundation of security that comes with Social Security. Ask any steel \nworker, any person who works for United Airlines or the airlines \nindustry who lost their pensions or the 14,000 people at Hewlett-\nPackard, and they will say that privatization of Social Security is a \nnonstarter.\n  Middle-class families are struggling. They have flat wages, a 55 \npercent increase in energy costs, 10 percent increase in health care \ncosts, 11 percent\n\n\nincrease in college costs. And what are we suggesting? Putting more \nrisk in their retirement plans. Public servants such as teachers, \npolice officers, fire fighters are being pressed out of the housing \nmarket. American families face more risk today, not less; and they do \nnot want the risk they are selling.\n  With a savings rate at a historic low, falling to just 1 percent last \nyear, we can pass the right legislation now to help people save for \ntheir retirement. Privatization stands in the way. Privatization of \nSocial Security has become the poison pill to progress.\n  The truth is both Republicans and Democrats have good ideas on \nretirement savings, and we could take several steps right now to help \nAmericans save for their retirement outside of Social Security. First, \nCongress should appoint a commission like in 1983 that said no to \nprivatization and we developed a plan that saved Social Security for 75 \nyears and in the meantime developed a bipartisan consensus on how to \nhelp Americans save for their retirement.\n  I have a couple ideas on what to do. First, I have introduced \nlegislation on the automatic enrollment into 401(k)s so people are \nautomatically enrolled in 401(k)s. My employees at RR Donnelley did \nthat, a Fortune 500 company; and their participation of savings went \nfrom 62 to 92 percent of employees participating. The Wall Street \nJournal reported today that 21 percent of all companies have \nimplemented automatic enrollment, up from 14 percent last year. This is \ngood news, but we can do more.\n  Second, at tax time, when people are filling out their taxes, allow \ndirect deposit of tax refunds into the savings account. Once a year \nabout $215 billion gets moved. It should not be moved to consumption, \nbut to savings. And if people pick 10 percent, 50 percent, 100 percent \nof their tax returns to go to savings, we would add not only who saves \nbut the amount of money that is saved in this country. A report by the \nRetirement Security Project of the Brookings Institute found that for \nevery year, 100 million people receive a Federal income tax on average \nof $2,000. We can have that directly deposited into their savings \naccounts like companies do today, and more and more Americans will not \nonly save for their retirement, but more dollars will be added to \nsavings.\n  Third, the Retirement Savings for Working Americans Act of 2005 makes \nthe saver's credit; so people who are earning $60,000 or less, the \nfirst $2,000 that they save would be matched by $1,000 by the Federal \nGovernment. It would help 50 million families with new incentives to \nsaving.\n  Fourth, we should consolidate the confusing ``alphabet soup'' of 16 \ndifferent savings plans into one portable pension.\n  Mr. Speaker, the vast majority of Americans have rejected the idea of \nprivatization of Social Security. By taking these steps, we can boost \nsavings outside of Social Security and provide Americans with a real \nsavings plan.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. EMANUEL", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6179-H6180", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "SOCIAL SECURITY", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6179-3", "title": "SOCIAL SECURITY"}
