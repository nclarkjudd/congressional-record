A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to assist \nhomeless students in obtaining postsecondary education, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M001111", "text": "  Ms. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I join Senator DeWine to introduce a \nbill that would make the dream of a college diploma more accessible to \nhomeless youth and kids in foster care.\n  We all know the obstacles students' in America need to overcome in \norder to succeed in post-secondary education. Couple these traditional \nobstacles with extreme poverty, residential instability, insufficient \ndocumentation and lack of awareness of supportive educational programs \nand it is no wonder homeless children and children in foster care are \nonly half as likely to go on to college as their peers.\n  Youth in foster care are less likely to be enrolled in college \npreparatory classes and are more than twice as likely as non-foster \ncare youth to drop out of high school altogether. Because The Higher \nEducation Act supports several programs that motivate and support \ndisadvantaged students to help increase their postsecondary educational \nattainment, it already has many of the tools necessary to intervene in \nthese student lives. My bill would help programs, such as TRIO and GEAR \nUP, target their resources to better serve homeless and foster care \npopulations. Early intervention is key in retaining these students and \npreparing them for post-secondary education.\n  More than 70 percent of teens in foster care desire to go to college, \nonly 27 percent of those who graduate from high school realize that \ndream. Although children and youth who experience the instability of \nhomelessness or foster care represent the full range of academic \ntalents and abilities, their situations create serious barriers to \nschool enrollment, attendance, and success.\n  Homeless and foster care youth do not have the traditional family \nnetwork to encourage or assist them in planning for a college \neducation. These youth need help to select a college, apply for \nadmission and obtaining financial aid. In addition, their student aid \nmust be used for so much more than just tuition and books. They face \nthe daunting challenges of housing, transportation and other basic \nneeds. By assisting these youth to become independent students we will \nincrease their access to student aid for financial aid purposes; \nimprove their changes for a smooth transition into, and completion of, \nhigher learning.\n  Our nation's economic well-being depends on our ability to provide \ngreater access to higher education for students, regardless of their \nfamily background. By passing this bill we guarantee more students than \never will be given the tools they need to attend college and succeed. \nThrough college we provide these vulnerable students with the best hope \nfor escaping the cycle of poverty and homelessness.\n  I look forward to working with HELP Committee Chairman Enzi to \nincorporate these provisions into the Higher Education Act \nreauthorization bill. And again, I thank Senator DeWine for his \ncommitment to these often overlooked children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. MURRAY", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "title", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                S. 1429\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "title", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) According to a study of foster care children in the \n     State of Washington, a child who enters foster care is likely \n     to have poorer academic outcomes than a child not in foster \n     care, even after controlling for a variety of factors such as \n     poverty.\n       (2) Youth in foster care--\n       (A) are less likely to be enrolled in college preparatory \n     classes than non-foster care youth; and\n       (B) are more than twice as likely as non-foster care youth \n     (37 percent as compared to 16 percent) to have dropped out of \n     secondary school.\n       (3) 50 percent of foster youth in the United States \n     graduate from secondary school, compared with 85 percent of \n     youth overall.\n       (4) 70 percent of teens in foster care desire to go to \n     college.\n       (5) A report from Casey Family Programs indicated that, \n     nationwide, less than 27 percent of foster youth who \n     graduated from secondary school went on to college, as \n     compared to 52 percent of the general population. Moreover, \n     the college dropout rate among foster youth is far higher \n     than the rate among other students.\n       (6) A May 2002 report issued by the University of \n     California at Berkeley found that, of more than 3,200 foster \n     care youth who attended a community college from 1992 through \n     2000--\n       (A) 39 percent earned between 1 and 17 credits;\n       (B) 40 percent of the foster care youth earned no credits; \n     and\n       (C) many of the foster care youth did not attempt to take \n     classes for credit, but rather were enrolled in remedial or \n     other non-credit classes.\n       (7) Unaccompanied youth experiencing homelessness often \n     have left home for their own survival.\n\n\n       (8) Although children and youth who experience homelessness \n     represent the full range of academic talents and abilities, \n     homelessness creates serious barriers to school enrollment, \n     attendance, and success.\n       (9) The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. \n     11301 et seq.) requires State educational agencies and local \n     educational agencies to ensure that homeless children and \n     youth receive a free and appropriate public education, but \n     these provisions do not reach beyond secondary education.\n       (10) The barriers created by homelessness to kindergarten \n     through grade 12 education (extreme poverty, residential \n     instability, lack of documentation, and lack of awareness of \n     programs and resources) often are also barriers to \n     postsecondary education.\n       (11) Higher education offers students experiencing \n     homelessness the best hope for escaping poverty and \n     homelessness as adults.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 5}, {"kind": "title", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "   TITLE I--FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE HOMELESS OR IN ", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 6}, {"kind": "title", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                              FOSTER CARE\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 7}, {"kind": "title", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, today I join Senator Murray in introducing \nthe ``Improving Access to Education for Students Who Are Homeless or in \nFoster Care Act.''

I have \nworked with her on provisions to promote their access to and completion \nof education in both the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n(IDEA) reauthorization and the Head Start Act reauthorization and am \npleased to have worked with her again on this bill.\n  In the United States, on any given day, more than half a million \nchildren are in foster care--20,000 of whom are in the State of Ohio, \nalone. In 2003, also know that more than 900,000 children were found to \nbe victims of child abuse or neglect. More than half of the children in \nfoster care experience developmental delays. Children in foster care \nhave three to seven times more chronic medical conditions, birth \ndefects, emotional disorders, and academic failures than children of \nsimilar socioeconomic backgrounds who do not enter foster care.\n  We also know that homeless children face great barriers to higher \neducation. Often, these students have run away from an abusive home, or \nhave been lost to the system. These students also may be living on the \nstreet with a parent--too often with a parent suffering from an \naddiction to alcohol or drugs. These children will move from school to \nschool and shelter to shelter, piecing together their education as they \ncan. This is not good enough. Although we have tried to reach out to \nthese students through the McKinney Vento Homelessness Assistance Act, \nwe need to do more. These children deserve a better chance at an \neducation.\n  Education offers foster care and homeless children their best hope \nfor escaping the poverty and instability they experience. This bill \nincludes additional outreach to these hard to reach populations through \ncurrent Federal education programs, such as TRIO and GEAR UP. It also \nwould expand and clarify the definition of ``Independent Student'' in \norder to accommodate the special circumstances of foster care and \nhomeless children and would allow student financial aid administrators \nadditional flexibility to help this cohort of students attain access to \nhigher education. This bill would create a $20 million demonstration \ngrant program targeting foster and homeless children to help decrease \nthe barriers to higher education by involving stakeholders and their \ncommunities in the outreach process.\n  I look forward to working with HELP Committee Chairman Enzi to \nincorporate these provisions into the Higher Education Act \nreauthorization bill. I appreciate his willingness to incorporate \nprovisions related to homeless and foster children in the Head Start \nAct reauthorization bill, as well. He is equally concerned with the \nwelfare of these children. And again, I thank Senator Murray for her \ncommitment to these children.

Mr. President, I join several of my colleagues today to \nintroduce a series of bills related to the reauthorization of the \nHigher Education Act (HEA). These bills emphasize a number of issues \nthat are vital to higher education, including teacher quality, \nrecruitment, and retention; loan forgiveness for social workers, family \nlawyers, and early childhood teachers; and the reduction of drug use \nand underage drinking at our colleges and universities.\n  The quality of a student's education is the direct result of the \nquality of that student's teachers. If we don't have well trained \nteachers, then future generations of our children will not be well \neducated. That is why I am introducing a bill ``Ready to Educate All \nChildren Act'' that would provide $200 million in grants to our schools \nof education to partner with high-need local schools to ensure that our \nteachers are receiving the best, most extensive training available \nbefore they enter the classroom.\n  Studies find that a majority of graduates of schools of education \nbelieve that the traditional teacher preparation program left them ill \nprepared for the challenges and rigors of the classroom. Part of the \nresponsibility for this lies in the hands of our schools of education. \nHowever, Congress also has a responsibility to give our schools of \neducation the tools they need to make necessary improvements. This new \nbill would create a competitive grant program for schools of education, \nwhich partner with low-income schools to create clinical programs to \ntrain teachers. Additionally, it would require schools of education to \nmake internal changes by working with other departments at the \nuniversity to ensure that teachers are receiving the highest quality \neducation in core academic subjects. Finally, it would require the \ncollege or university to demonstrate a commitment to improving their \nschools of education by providing matching funds.\n  Another bill I am introducing today, is the ``Collaborative \nAgreements to Recruit Educators Act,'' which also would encourage \nimprovement in the education of our Nation's low-income students. \nChildren raised in poverty have a much more difficult time in finishing \nhigh school and going on to college. While about seventy percent of \nchildren in America will graduate from high school, that rate drops to \nfifty percent for low-income students. We know that every day, about \n3,000 children drop out of school. Our Nation's inner city schools have \nsome of the lowest rates of graduation. I strongly believe that \neducation is one of the most important ways to break the cycle of \npoverty. To break that cycle, we must keep our children in school, help \nthem graduate from high school, and increase their access to higher \neducation.\n  My bill would provide grants for collaborative agreements to between \nlocal education agencies in low-income communities and to colleges of \neducation. These partnerships would work to provide services, such as \nmentoring, tutoring, and scholarships through the college of education \nto the students at the partnering school in order to 1. encourage those \nstudents to graduate from high school, 2. let them know of \nopportunities within higher education, and (3) encourage them to become \nteachers, which are so badly needed.\n  Another complex issue affecting the teaching force is the high \npercentage of disillusioned beginning teachers who leave the field. \nThis bill would help combat this issue, as well. Schools of education \nreceiving these grants would be responsible for following their \ngraduates and continuing to provide assistance after they enter the \nclassroom. The more we invest in the education of teachers--especially \nonce they have entered the profession--the more likely they will remain \nin the classroom.\n  To further help teacher quality and retention, I am introducing a \nbill ``The Master Teacher Scholarship Act''--to establish a Master's in \nEducation Scholarship Program. The lack of promotions and salary \nincreases are some of the most pervasive reasons for the \ndisillusionment of teachers. This disillusionment is becoming a crisis \nas half of teachers leave the profession altogether within their first \nfive years of teaching. To both improve the quality of teachers and \nincrease their retention, this bill would provide $30 million in grants \nto schools of education to administer scholarships to eligible \nteachers. In return for the scholarships, teachers would agree to teach \nfor another five years and mentor a novice teacher for two years.\n  Today, along with Senator Dodd, I am introducing the ``Paul Wellstone \nEarly Educator Loan Forgiveness Act.'' Our dear friend and colleague, \nSenator Wellstone, and I had been working on this legislation together \nbefore his tragic death. I know he cared deeply about this issue and \nabout making sure that all children receive a quality education. He was \npassionate about that. Though our bill was originally called the \n``Early Care and Education Loan Forgiveness Act,'' we have renamed our \nbill in Paul's memory.\n  Our bill would expand the loan forgiveness program so that it \nbenefits not just childcare workers, but also early childhood \neducators. This loan forgiveness program would serve as an incentive to \nkeep those educators in the field for longer periods of time. Research \nshows that children who attend quality early childcare programs when \nthey were three or four years old scored better on math, language arts, \nand social skills in early elementary school than children who attended \npoor quality childcare programs. In short, children in early learning \nprograms with high quality teachers--teachers with a Bachelor's degree \nor an Associate's degree or higher--do substantially better.\n  When we examine the number and recent growth of pre-primary education \nprograms, it becomes difficult to differentiate between early education \nand childcare settings because they are so often intertwined--\nespecially considering that about 12 million children younger than age \nfive spend part of their time with a care provider other than a parent \nand that demand for quality childcare and education is growing as more \nmothers enter the workforce.\n  Because this bill targets loan forgiveness to those educators working \nin low-income schools or childcare settings, we can make significant \nstrides toward providing high quality education for all of our young \nchildren, regardless of socioeconomic status. The bill would serve a \ntwofold function. First, it would reward professionals for their \ntraining. Second, it would encourage professionals to remain in the \nprofession over longer periods of time, since more time in the \nprofession leads to higher percentages of loans forgiveness. The bill \nwould result in more educated individuals with more teaching experience \nand lower turnover rates, each of which enhance student performance.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort to help ensure \nthat truly\n\n\nno children--especially our youngest children--are left behind.\n  I also am working on two bills with my friend and colleague from West \nVirginia, Senator Rockefeller. These bills would provide loan \nforgiveness to students who dedicate their careers to working in the \nrealm of child welfare, including social workers, who work for child \nprotective services, and family law experts.\n\n  Currently, there aren't enough social workers to fill available jobs \nin the area of child welfare. Furthermore, the number of social work \njob openings is expected to increase faster than the average for all \noccupations through 2010. The need for highly qualified social workers \nin the child protective services is reaching crisis level.\n  We also need more qualified individuals focusing on family law. The \nwonderful thing about family law is its focus on rehabilitation--that \nis the rehabilitation of families by helping them through life's \ntransitions, whether it is a family going through a divorce, a family \ndealing with their troubled teenager in the juvenile system, or a child \ngetting adopted and becoming a member of a new family.\n  Across the United States, family, juvenile, and domestic relations \ncourts are experiencing a shortage of qualified attorneys. As many of \nmy colleagues and I know, law school is an expensive investment. In the \nlast 20 years, tuition has increased more than 200 percent. Currently, \nthe average rate of law school debt is about $80,000 per graduate. To \nbe sure, few law school graduates can afford to work in the public \nsector because debts prevent even the most dedicated public service \nlawyer from being able to take these low-paying jobs. This results in a \nshortage of family lawyers.\n  The shortage of family law attorneys also disproportionately impacts \njuveniles. The lack of available representation causes children to \nspend more time in foster care because cases are adjourned or postponed \nwhen they simply cannot find an attorney to represent their rights or \nthose of the parent or guardian. Furthermore, the number of children \ninvolved in the court system is sharply increasing. We need to ensure \nthat the interests of these children are taken care of by making \ncertain they have an advocate--someone working solely on their behalf. \nBy offering loan forgiveness to those willing to pursue careers in the \nchild welfare field, we can increase the number of highly qualified and \ndedicated individuals who work in the realm of child welfare and family \nlaw.\n  Finally, I am introducing a bill today that would help address an \nepidemic--the epidemic of underage drinking on college and university \ncampuses across the United States. This bill would provide grants to \nstates to establish statewide partnerships among colleges and \nuniversities and the surrounding communities to work together to reduce \nunderage and binge drinking and illicit drug use by students.\n  Many States, including my home State of Ohio, have coalitions that \ndeal specifically with the culture of alcohol and drug abuse on \nAmerica's college campuses. They work with the surrounding communities, \nincluding local residents; bar, restaurant, and shop owners; and law \nenforcement officials toward a goal of changing the pervasive culture \nof drug and alcohol abuse. They provide alternative alcohol-free \nevents, as well as support groups for those who choose not to drink. \nThey also educate students about the dangers of alcohol and drug use.\n  Furthermore, the coalitions recognize that while it is important to \npromote an alcohol aware and drug-free campus community, if the \ncommunity surrounding the campus does not promote these initiatives, \nthere will be no long-term solutions. Therefore, these coalitions also \nhave worked to establish regulations both on and off campus, which will \nhelp our Nation's youth to stay healthy, alive, and get the most out of \ntheir time at college. Some of these regulations include the \nregistration of kegs. This provides accountability for both the store \nand the student. This is just an example of one step that colleges, \nlocal communities, and organizations can take.\n  To help start the expansion of these coalitions, this bill would \nprovide $5 million in grants. This is an important demonstration \nproject that would help lead to positive effects for our young people. \nIt is up to us to change the culture, which has been perpetuated by \nyears of complacency and a dismissal tone of ``that's just the way it \nis in college.'' We must protect the health and education of our young \npeople by changing this culture of abuse--and that is exactly what this \nbill would help do.\n  I thank all of my colleagues who have worked with me on these bills. \nI look forward to the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act and \nworking with Chairman Enzi and Ranking Member Kennedy to incorporate \nthese important measures.", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. DeWINE", "itemno": 43}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                 ______", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 44}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 1439.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the, Indian \nTrust Reform Act of 2005.\n  The following is an overview of the bill, title by title, which is \nfollowed by a discussion of the reasons for the measure.\n\n\nTitle I: Resolution of historical accounting claims in Cobell v. Norton\n\n  Title I of the bill would provide for a lump sum settlement of the \nclaims for an historical accounting that have been asserted in the case \nof Cobell v. Norton. The section would establish a Settlement Fund \nwhich would be administered by the Secretary of the Treasury and a \nSpecial Master. The total amount of the fund is left blank in this \nintroduced version of the bill. The Committee on Indian Affairs will \nhold a hearing on this soon and have further discussions with the \nparties, hopefully to reach a consensus number for the settlement. The \nsettlement fund would be distributed to individual Indians using two \nformulas: part of the fund would be distributed among all claimants \nequally, and part would be distributed under a formula that allocates \nfunds in accordance with a through-put analysis--account holders with \nhigh volume accounts would receive more than those with low volume \naccounts. A portion of the fund would be held in reserve for payment of \nattorneys fees at an hourly rate, for administration of the fund and \nfor claimants who successfully challenge their distribution in court. \nIf any of the reserved funds remain unused, they are to be distributed \nto the claimants under the formula.\n\n\n    Title II: Indian Trust Asset Management Policy Review Commission\n\n  Title II of the bill establishes and sets forth the duties, \nresponsibilities, and authority of a 12-member Indian Trust Asset \nManagement Review Commission. The Commission would have two principal \nareas of responsibility: 1. Reviewing all current trust resource \nmanagement laws, (including regulations), and the Secretary of \nInterior's trust resource management practices, and 2. Following that \nreview, preparing a report to the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, \nthe House Committee on Resources and the Secretary of Interior \ncontaining the Commission's recommendations for improving the \nmanagement of those assets.\n\n\n   Title III: Indian Trust Resource Management Demonstration Project\n\n  Title III of the bill establishes an eight-year Indian Trust Resource \nManagement Demonstration Project. The demonstration project would \ninitially be open to all Indian tribes participating in section 131 of \nthe Fiscal Year 2005 Interior Appropriations Act and an additional 30 \nIndian tribes that submit applications to the Secretary. Participating \ntribes would negotiate a ``trust resource management plan'' with the \nSecretary, which would remain in effect for the full duration of the \ndemonstration project but would be subject to modification or \ntermination annually. A participating tribe would be allowed to \nnegotiate with the Department of Interior as to how the trust asset \nmanagement budget for the reservation would be prioritized. Self-\ngovernance tribes participating in the demonstration project would also \nbe permitted to develop their own ``customized'' trust asset management \nsystems and practices. Trust assets subject to the plan would have to \nbe managed in accordance with 1. The Federal trust responsibility and \n2. Certain basic standards set forth in the section. The trust asset \nmanagement plan itself would not create, diminish or increase\n\n\nthe liability of either the United States or the Indian tribe. The \nIndian tribe would have the right to terminate the plan by giving the \nSecretary notice, but termination would not be effective until the \nbeginning of the next fiscal year.\n\n\n    Title IV: Fractional Interest Purchase and Consolidation Program\n\n  Title IV of the bill would be an amendment to Section 213 of the \nIndian Land Consolidation Act (25 USC 2212). As currently written, \nSection 213 of ILCA authorizes the Secretary to purchase fractional \ninterests in land in accordance with certain requirements. One problem \nwith this program is that the fractional interests are so small that an \noffer of fair market value is such a small amount of money that there \nis little incentive to sell. Accordingly, the amendment would be a new \nsubsection to ILCA Section 213 that would authorize the Secretary to \noffer more than fair market value for fractional interests in tracts of \nland that have 20 or more trust or restricted fractional interests--the \noffer would be fair market value PLUS an additional amount of at least \n$100 but not more than $350.\n  Also, this title would add another new subsection to ILCA section 213 \nthat would authorize the Secretary to offer, along with an offer to \npurchase any interest or interests under section 213, an additional \namount of money to settle any and all mismanagement claims against the \nUnited States that the interest owner may have in connection with the \ntract of land of which the fractional interest is a part. The interest \nowner would have the option of selling his or her interest to the \nSecretary with or without a settlement of mismanagement claims, i.e., \nthe settlement of mismanagement claims could not be made a mandatory \ncondition of the sale of the interest.\n  Also included as part of this title is a provision dealing with \ntracts of extremely fractionated land--specifically, tracts of land \nthat consist of 200 or more fractional trust interests. If the \nSecretary determines that a tract is owned by 200 or more individuals, \nshe is authorized to make the offer (not less than four times fair \nmarket value) via certified mail to each and every trust interest owner \nin the tract. The offer would include a notice that says they have 90 \ndays to reject the offer or it will be deemed to have been accepted. It \nwould include a pre-addressed (back to the Secretary) postage-paid \n``notice of rejection'' form that the offeree may use to reject the \noffer. If they fail to mail the form back in time, they will be given \nanother notice stating that they may withdraw the offer by mailing a \npostage pre-paid ``notice of withdrawal'' form back to the Secretary \nwithin 30 days. If They fail to do that in time, the offer is deemed to \nbe accepted.\n\n\n Title V: Restructuring the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Office of the \n                            Special Trustee\n\n  This title of the bill would reorganize the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nand Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians under a new \noffice within the Department of Interior, an Under Secretary for Indian \nAffairs. The title provides that the Under Secretary has \nresponsibility for the administration of all Indian trust and non-trust \nmatters, including, after a transition period ending on December 31, \n2008, matters currently within the scope of authority of the Special \nTrustee for American Indians under the American Indian Trust Fund \nManagement Reform Act of 1994 (25 USC 4041 et seq.). The Under \nSecretary would oversee a new Office of Trust Reform Implementation and \nOversight, but the Special Trustee would continue performing his duties \nunder the 1994 Act until December 31, 2008, at which time the OST would \nbe abolished.\n\n\n    Title VI: Annual Audit of Indian Trust Funds by the Government \n                         Accountability Office\n\n  Title VI of the bill requires the Government Accountability Office to \ncontract for an annual audit of all funds held in trust by the United \nStates for the benefit of an Indian Tribe or an individual Indian. The \naudit would be conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing \nprinciples and the Single Audit Act. Copies of each audit report must \nbe submitted to the Secretary of Interior, the Senate Committee on \nIndian Affairs, and the House Committee on Resources.\n  Reasons for the bill: the performance of the United States over the \npast 125 years in its capacity as trustee and manager of Indian trust \nand restricted lands is not something to be proud of. The policy of \nallotting Indian tribal lands, which was made the general Federal \nIndian policy in the 1880s, was one of several federal ``experiments'' \nin Indian matters that have had regrettable results both for Native \nAmericans and for the Government. This policy of the 19th Century has \ncome back to haunt us now in the form of fractionated ownership of \nallotted lands--where some parcels of land are owned by hundreds and in \nsome cases over a thousand different Indian owners. This fractionation \nof ownership has led to a proliferation of individual Indian money \naccounts ``IIM accounts,'' now numbering in the hundreds of thousands, \nall of which the Federal Government has a trust obligation to track and \nmanage.\n  The staggering number of IIM accounts--along with decades of \nmismanagement on the part of Government officials--contributed to the \nconditions that led to the filing of the Federal class action here in \nthe District of Columbia known as Cobell v. Norton. A lot has happened \nin that litigation since it was filed 9 years ago, much of it reported \nin newspapers across the country, but I think it is fair to say that \none thing the case has shown is that the United States has not lived up \nto its duty as a fiduciary to the thousands of Indian beneficiaries of \nIIM accounts.\n  The principal objectives of the Cobell case are to obtain a complete \nhistorical accounting of IIM accounts and to reform the trust itself. \nThe Government has been ordered to perform a complete, detailed \naccounting of transactions relating to IIM accounts and to submit and \nimplement a plan to reform the trust. In hearings before the Committee \non Indian Affairs, officials from the Department of Interior have \nstated that the cost of doing the accounting may run in to multiple \nbillions of dollars, and representatives of the plaintiffs in the case \nas well as the GAO, have stated that much of this accounting cannot be \ndone due to missing or destroyed records, information, or data relating \nto the IIM accounts.\n  The bill I introduce today would provide a resolution of the class \naction relating to an historical accounting and would also bring a \nnumber of important changes to the Indian trust asset management \nsystem. In lieu of an accounting, the bill would create a settlement \nfund and direct the Secretary of the Treasury to develop a formula for \ndistributing the fund to the beneficial owners of IIM accounts in full \nsettlement for losses, errors, and unpaid interest in their IIM \naccounts. Several other aspects of the bill are included for the \npurpose of reforming the Indian trust management system. For example, \nthe bill would create a special commission charged with the \nresponsibility of examining current Indian trust management laws, \nregulations and practices and reporting back to the authorizing \ncommittees of jurisdiction in the Senate and House with recommended \nrevisions of these laws, regulations and practices. It would also \nrestructure the Bureau of Indian Affairs under an Under Secretary For \nIndian Affairs, phasing out the Office of the Special Trustee whose \nresponsibilities would be transferred to the Under Secretary after \nDecember 31, 2008.\n  I would like to thank the National Congress of American Indians, the \nInter-Tribal Monitoring Association, the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest \nIndians, representatives of the plaintiffs as well as many other \nstakeholders for their considerable and helpful input in developing \nthis legislation. The bill does not include everything that they \nrequested, and they may have issues with certain aspects of the bill as \nit is now written. That said, the bill is offered as a starting point \nfor discussion. I do not think that there is any provision in the bill \nthat is immutable, closed to debate or negotiation. Hopefully the \nstakeholders will remain engaged and continue to provide me with \ninformation and suggestions to make it a better bill, a bill that \nbrings substantial improvements to the administration and management of \nIndian trust assets.\n\n\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to enact this timely legislation.

Recently, the \nparties engaged in a 9-month mediation process that failed to result in \nany type of potential resolution. This litigation is nearly a decade \nold and has no end in sight. It is my hope that this bill will assist \nthe parties in reaching some type of resolution of this litigation.\n  The individual Indian trust account system was not a voluntary system \nelected by the individual Indians, but rather one imposed upon them by \nthe federal government more than one hundred years ago. The Federal \nGovernment serves as trustee of these accounts and the individual \nIndians are beneficiaries. Unfortunately, the Cobell litigation has \nbrought to light a very disturbing problem: the Federal Government, as \ntrustee, may not be able to provide an accurate and proper historical \naccounting of these accounts. Moreover, the Federal Government may not \nknow the proper balances of these accounts nor have sufficient \ndocumentation to determine the value of these accounts. Further, \ngovernment officials have stated that a full transaction-by-transaction \naccounting, presuming one can be performed, would cost more than $10 \nbillion. This cost would not include any monies determined to be \nunaccounted for or the interest on those monies.\n  The claims in the Cobell litigation on examples of broken promises \nand trust responsibilities to the Native Americans of this country, but \nit is my hope and desire that this bill will help us keep those \npromises, fulfill our responsibilities to Native Americans, and restore \ntrust and faith in our government. If Congress continues to allow the \nCobell litigation to proceed, the individual beneficiaries of these \naccounts will not be alive to reap the benefits these accounts and the \ntrust resource management system were intended to bestow.\n  It is an honor to serve as Vice Chairman of the Committee on Indian \nAffairs alongside chairman McCain. We have publicly pledged that we \nwill make our best effort to resolve this long overdue injustice to the \nfirst Americans. The introduction of this bill is the first step toward \nthat goal.\n", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. DORGAN", "itemno": 102}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 103}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "S8560-S8573", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "S", "context": "HEADERLINE", "congress": "109", "number": "1429"}, {"type": "S", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "109", "number": "1429"}, {"type": "S", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "109", "number": "1429"}, {"type": "S", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "109", "number": "1430"}, {"type": "S", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "109", "number": "1431"}, {"type": "S", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "109", "number": "1432"}, {"type": "S", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "109", "number": "1433"}, {"type": "S", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "109", "number": "1434"}, {"type": "S", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "109", "number": "1435"}, {"type": "S", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "109", "number": "1436"}, {"type": "S", "context": "HEADERLINE", "congress": "109", "number": "1439"}, {"type": "S", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "109", "number": "1439"}], "doc_title": "STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgS8560"}
