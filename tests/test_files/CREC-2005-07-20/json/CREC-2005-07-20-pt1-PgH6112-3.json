Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Central \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement. The Central American Free Trade \nAgreement. We use this acronym frequently, CAFTA. It is Central \nAmerica, our brothers and sisters and the future of the world when it \ncomes to the corridor for an economic base that is unlimited into South \nAmerica and Central America.\n  Exports to Central America from my home State of Nevada grew 56 \npercent from 2000 to 2004, far higher than the 16 percent average \nincrease. In 2003 alone, Nevada experienced an 88 percent increase with \nsignificant gains in machinery, computer and electronic manufacturing.\n  Manufactured goods accounted for 69 percent of Nevada's exports to \nCentral America. Not only will the passage of CAFTA immediately \neliminate tariffs on 80 percent of exports on Nevada's manufacturers; \nit will also abolish all remaining tariffs within 10 years, including \nthe tariff on chemicals, electronic equipment, machinery, and \ntransportation equipment.\n  Mr. Speaker, Central American Free Trade Agreement, the future \neconomic base of the world is Central and South America.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PORTER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6112", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "CENTRAL AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6112-3", "title": "CENTRAL AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT"}
