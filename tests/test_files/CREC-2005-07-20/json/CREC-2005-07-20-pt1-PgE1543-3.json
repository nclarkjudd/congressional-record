Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and bring \nattention to the illegal Turkish invasion and occupation of Cyprus. It \nwas 31 years ago today that Turkey invaded Cyprus. During the invasion \nthey expelled 200,000 Greek-Cypriots from their homes and \nneighborhoods, making them refugees overnight. Turkish troops killed \n5,000 Greek-Cypriots, of which 1,500 are still missing. There have been \n30,000 Turkish troops occupying the island nation of Cyprus ever since.\n  It is the proper role of the Members of the United States Congress to \nnot only condemn the brutal Turkish invasion of 1974, but also to urge \nthe next step in addressing the issues of the past. We must promote a \nplan for reunification that addresses the serious concerns of all \nCypriots. We must encourage Turkish-Cypriot leaders and their Greek-\nCypriot counterparts to negotiate in good faith. We must show the world \nthat the reunification of Cyprus is a priority for the United States.\n  On the 31st anniversary of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, we grieve \nfor those killed during the invasion, and we lament the lost \nopportunities for reunification over the years. We urge both parties to \ncontinue to work toward a reunited and peaceful Cyprus.\n\n\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ROTHMAN", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 5}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1543-E1544", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "THE 31ST ANNIVERSARY OF THE ILLEGAL TURKISH INVASION AND OCCUPATION OF CYPRUS", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgE1543-3", "title": null}
