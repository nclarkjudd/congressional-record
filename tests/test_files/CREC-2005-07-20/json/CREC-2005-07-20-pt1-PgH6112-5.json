Mr. Speaker, as the global war on \nterrorism continues, State Defense Forces are playing an increasingly \ncritical role in ensuring that their communities are prepared for \nHomeland Security crises and recovery from hurricane damage.\n  As a 31-year veteran of the South Carolina Army National Guard, I am \nwell aware of the valuable contributions of the South Carolina State \nGuard. From training monthly to supporting National Guard operations, \nthese capable men and women honorably offer their time and experience \nfor their communities.\n  To ensure that these volunteers are used to their greatest potential, \nthe gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Davis) and I have reintroduced the \nState Defense Forces Improvement Act. This legislation will recognize \nthe importance of the State Defense Forces, authorize DOD and DHS to \ncoordinate Homeland Security efforts with and provide training to State \nDefense Forces and allow State Defense Forces to receive surplus DOD \nequipment.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget \nSeptember 11.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. WILSON of South Carolina", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6112", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "STATE DEFENSE FORCES", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6112-5", "title": "STATE DEFENSE FORCES"}
