Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage our colleagues to \npass the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement, or \nDR-CAFTA, when it comes before the House. DR-CAFTA is vital to our \nNation's economic competitiveness in today's global marketplace and \nwill serve as an economic engine for driving growth and economic \nopportunity in the United States and Central America.\n  In Florida, the Nation's gateway for trade with Central America, we \nrecognize the importance of this regional bloc. The DR-CAFTA countries \nrepresent our State's largest export market and the second largest \nUnited States market in Latin America. By lowering trade barriers, we \ncan expand this market even further. That is good news for Florida \nbusinesses, good news for Florida agricultural products, and good news \nfor Florida workers. The American Farm Bureau estimates that United \nStates exports for agricultural goods could increase by $1.5 billion \neach year.\n  This agreement has generated thoughtful bipartisan support from \nvarious agricultural, textile, business and political groups. Former \nUnited States President Carter as well as several key Clinton \nadministration officials support DR-CAFTA. I encourage my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this crucial trade agreement that will help \npromote economic growth, political stability and regional security.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. HARRIS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6114", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "DR-CAFTA", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6114-4", "title": "DR-CAFTA"}
