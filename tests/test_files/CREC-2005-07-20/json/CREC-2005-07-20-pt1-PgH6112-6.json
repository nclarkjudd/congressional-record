Mr. Speaker, today's New York Times states that a \nLondon-based group of academics and researchers has released a report \non civilian casualties in Iraq for the first 2 years of the war. The \nreport, based on analysis of civilian casualties reported in the news \nmedia, states that 24,865 civilians were killed and about 42,500 \nwounded.\n  The report goes on to list its findings specifically. We also know \nthat there is another study which was published in October of 2004 in \nthe Lancet, the British medical journal, according to the New York \nTimes, that says that some of the estimates of Iraqi civilian deaths \nrange as high as 100,000.\n  I have stood on this floor many times and bemoaned the loss of our \nAmerican troops, but I think in the name of humanity we have to start \nthinking\n\n\nabout the impact that this war is having on the civilians in Iraq. \nTheir lives are being destroyed. Their families are being wiped out.\n  House Joint Resolution 55 sets the stage for bringing our troops home \nand ending this tragedy in Iraq.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KUCINICH", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6112-H6113", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HJRES", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "109", "number": "55"}], "doc_title": "CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN IRAQ", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6112-6"}
