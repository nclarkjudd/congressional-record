Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 31st \nAnniversary of the Turkish Invasion of Cyprus. First, I would like to \nacknowledge Representative Bilirakis and Representative Maloney for \ntheir efforts in bringing this issue to Congress.\n  Today, as you well know marks the Anniversary of a day 31 years ago \nwhen the people of Cyprus's lives changed. In 1974, Turkish forces \ninvaded Northern Cyprus and seized control of more than one-third of \nthe Island. Cyprus has for the past 31 years been divided by a 113 mile \nbarbed wire fence that runs across the island. Therefore, Greek \nCypriotes are prohibited from visiting the towns and communities where \ntheir families have lived for generations. In 1983, illegal occupiers \nof the island declared the territory to be an independent state and \ncalled it the ``Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,'' a country which \ntoday remains shunned by the International Community and is not \nrecognized by anyone besides Turkey. Currently there are over 35,000 \nTurkish troops illegally stationed and it continues to be one of the \nmost militarized areas in the world.\n  I commend the United States Government, the European Union and the \nUnited Nations for encouraging a solution to the problem plaguing \nCyprus. I sincerely hope that by taking a stance today, we can promote \na renewed effort for direct negotiations and help the Greek Cypriotes \nget back what is rightfully theirs.\n  I would like to express my support of the Greek Cypriotes who have \nbeen disenfranchised for generations and continue to be mistreated \ntoday.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CROWLEY", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1555", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "THE 31ST BLACK ANNIVERSARY OF THE TURKISH INVASION OF CYPRUS", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgE1555-2", "title": "THE 31ST BLACK ANNIVERSARY OF THE TURKISH INVASION OF CYPRUS"}
