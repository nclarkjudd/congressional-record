Mr. Speaker, last week the minority leader told reporters \nthat ``it is essential for us,'' meaning Democrats, ``to take down \ntheir numbers,'' meaning Republicans. And she went on to cite the \nreasons it is more important to tear down Republicans than offer an \nactual agenda.\n  It is obvious from these statements that the Democrat leader's main \nstrategy is obstruction and politics. They care more about partisan \nspin and negative attacks than ideas and progress.\n  However, Republican policies are lowering the deficit created by \nrecession and terrorist attacks. Republican policies have spurred the \ncreation of a million jobs this year. Republican policies have allowed \nthe economy to grow faster than any other industrialized country.\n  And Republican leadership, as opposed to decades of Democrat \ncomplacency, have led us into the national discussion on the future of \nour most important retirement program, Social Security.\n  The Democratic agenda has lost at the polls. If they cared more about \nworking families than their poll numbers, maybe they would start \nwinning elections again.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PITTS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6111", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "DEMOCRATS SHOULD CARE MORE ABOUT POLICY THAN POLITICS", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6111", "title": "DEMOCRATS SHOULD CARE MORE ABOUT POLICY THAN POLITICS"}
