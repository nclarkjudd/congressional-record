Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the so-called Central \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, also called CAFTA.\n  Mr. Speaker, I address this House from the perspective of the \nAmerican worker. Prior to my election to Congress, I had a chance to \nview the effect of U.S. trade policy at its most basic level, that of \nthe American worker.\n  Prior to coming to this Congress, I worked for about 20 years as an \nironworker and a welder. I worked at the General Motors assembly plant \nin Framingham, Massachusetts, prior to GM's decision to close the \nFramingham plant and several Michigan plants and instead expand their \nplants in Mexico.\n  I also worked as a welder at the General Dynamics shipyard in Quincy, \nMassachusetts, before foreign competition and misguided trade policy \nmoved that work overseas.\n  I worked at the U.S. steel mill in Gary, Indiana, and at the Inland \nsteel plant in East Chicago, Indiana, as an ironworker prior to the \nsteel industry moving to Third World countries in order to escape \nresponsible labor and environmental standards.\n  I have seen firsthand the effect of anti-worker trade policies on the \nAmerican workers and their families. I have seen the devastation that \noccurs in American cities and towns when we adopt trade policies that \nencourage U.S. companies to relocate jobs overseas. And I have seen \nwhat the impact is on our schools and the fabric of our very \ncommunities when large employers shut down the largest plants in town.\n  I have been impressed since coming to Congress with how people talk \nabout job loss. People in Washington talk about job loss like they are \ntalking about the weather or some natural occurrence, like a giant cold \nfront moved through here and took about 3 million American jobs with \nit.\n  Well, American job loss is the result of deliberate policies that \nhave been misguided and have encouraged U.S. employers to locate their \njobs overseas. It is time to stop these U.S. policies that simply \nexploit foreign workers by adopting trade agreements and that have no \nlabor or environmental standards.\n  Our experience with NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, \nshould inform our decision today. At the time of NAFTA's passage in \n1993, the U.S. trade deficit was about $39 billion. Since then, it has \nsoared to about $617 billion in 2004. That is a whopping 1,600 percent \nincrease and more than 5 percent of our national GDP.\n  It is ironic indeed today when we talk so much about exporting \ndemocracy because of our situation in Iraq, that what we are doing here \nis exporting U.S. jobs, and at the same time endorsing the creation of \n$2-a-day jobs in Central America.\n  I think we have a fatal flaw in our foreign policy, in our trade \npolicy. First of all, you do not export democracy through the Defense \nDepartment, you do it through the U.S. Trade Representative and through \nour trade agreements; and you do not export democracy by forcing \nworkers to work for $2 a day. For if you follow the path of \nexploitation fostered by mercenary and winner-take-all trade agreements \nthat set worker against worker in a race to the bottom, in the end you \nwill in those countries see a retrenchment of hope and a rejection of \ndemocracy.\n  I have seen firsthand the effects of an errant trade policy. It is \ntime today to reject this current CAFTA and to ask our U.S. Trade \nRepresentative to go back to the drawing board and come up with a CAFTA \nthat is truly good for the American worker and good for the workers in \nCentral America.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. LYNCH", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6181", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "OPPOSING THE SO-CALLED CENTRAL AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6181-2", "title": "OPPOSING THE SO-CALLED CENTRAL AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT"}
