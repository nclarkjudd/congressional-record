Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the U.S.-Dominican \nRepublic-Central American Free Trade Agreement.\n  Upon its implementation DR-CAFTA will allow goods and services to be \ntraded among these countries without tariffs or other trade barriers. \nCurrently, the United States has significant barriers to those \ncountries. Those countries do not have significant barriers into the \nUnited States.\n  The benefits of DR-CAFTA go well beyond the free movement of goods. \nThis agreement will solidify the political enlightenment that has taken \nplace over the past decade in Central America and the Dominican \nRepublic. In the not so distant past communists and generals ruled the \nDR-CAFTA countries. Today freedom and democracy rule these lands.\n  DR-CAFTA will continue to enhance these fragile democracies by \ncommitting them to free and open economies and create new opportunities \nfor their economies and workers. The agreement\n\n\nwill lead to stability and propel these countries forward, rather than \nallow them to backslide into dangerous political and economic policies \nthat have hindered other countries in Latin America.\n  Politically and economically stable countries, especially those in \nour hemisphere, are vital to our national security here in the United \nStates, and I urge my colleagues to support this very important \nagreement.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. HART", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6174-H6175", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "FREE TRADE FLOW WITH CAFTA", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6174-6", "title": "FREE TRADE FLOW WITH CAFTA"}
