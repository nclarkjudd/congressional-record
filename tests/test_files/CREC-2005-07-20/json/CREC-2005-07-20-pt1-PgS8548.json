Mr. President, I rise today to salute an extraordinary \nnative Iowan who has fallen in service to his country in support of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. PFC Eric P. Woods, of the 2nd Squadron, 3rd \nArmored Cavalry Regiment, died on the 9th day of July, 2005, in Tal \nAfar, Iraq, due to injuries sustained when an explosive device \ndetonated under his vehicle. Woods, a combat medic was killed en route \nto aid an injured soldier. My prayers go out to his wife Jamie, his 3-\nyear-old son Eric Scott, his parents Charles and Janis Woods, and his \nmany other friends and family.\n  Eric Woods grew up in Urbandale, IA, and was an active member in the \nyouth group at Westchester Evangelical Free Church. At Urbandale High \nSchool he wrestled and played football and baseball before graduating \nin 1997. While attending Iowa State University, he became manager of \nKrause Gentle Company. After a move to Omaha, Eric became a medic in \nthe U.S. Army.\n  Private First Class Woods was a truly thoughtful soldier, requesting \npackages from home containing soccer balls, candy, and toys to give out \nto the children of Iraq. He will be remembered not only for his \nsacrifice for freedom but also the way in which he served, giving his \nlife on the way to help an injured fellow soldier. Recently, his pastor \nsaid of Eric: ``His motto was to charge, not retreat. He squeezed the \nmost out of life.'' Again my thoughts and prayers are with his family \nand friends. I ask my colleagues in the Senate and all Americans to \nremember with gratitude and admiration this courageous Iowan, PFC Eric \nP. Woods.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GRASSLEY", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "S8548", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgS8548", "title": "HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES"}
