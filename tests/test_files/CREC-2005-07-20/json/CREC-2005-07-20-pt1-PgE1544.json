Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support \nof H. Con. Res. 175, a resolution acknowledging African descendants of \nthe transatlantic slave trade in all of the Americas and recommending \nthat the United States and the international community work to improve \nthe situation of Afro-descendant communities in Latin America and the \nCaribbean.\n  The early history of the Americas is plagued with immeasurable acts \nof violence and inhumane cruelties. The establishment of the \ntransatlantic slave trade is merely one of numerous blemishes that \nremain a part of our troubled past. From the late fifteenth through \nnineteenth centuries, an estimated ten million Africans were abducted, \nbound and shipped as human cargo to the Americas.\n  These men, women and children were used to build the foundation of \nnations spanning Latin America, North America and the Caribbean. Words \ncan hardly do justice to the struggle these individuals faced on a \ndaily basis. Working endless hours through unbearable conditions, \nAfrican slaves constantly fought a losing battle to survive. Though \ndisbanded several hundred years ago, the legacy of this institution \nremains imbedded in our societies even today.\n  African descendants throughout the Americas have historically \nsuffered from societal and governmental marginalization. In the United \nStates, African descendants experience disproportionately high infant \nmortality, illiteracy and poverty rates. As a nation, we have worked to \nfight against these racial disparities, yet they continue to persist.\n  Only recently have similar trends been analyzed and acknowledged in \nLatin American and Caribbean countries. This fight is ongoing both at \nhome and abroad. We must extend our reach beyond domestic policy to \nadvance an international discussion of racial issues.\n  Though America aspires to lead the world in the realm of economic \npolicies and technological innovation, it constantly falls short of \npromoting racial equality. As pioneers in all other industries, it is \nour duty to be at the forefront of all efforts geared towards amending \nthe social and economic disparities that continue to haunt African \ndescendants in the Americas.\n  The largest number of Afro-descendants living outside of Africa can \nbe found in Latin America and the Caribbean. These individuals share in \nour early history and suffer from the residual effects that are \nevidenced in our own communities. It is equally our responsibility to \naid and assist Latin American and Caribbean nations' efforts to \novercome their institutionalized racial disparities. Our common past \nwill forever link our futures.\n  Mr. Speaker, this resolution serves as a reminder of the history \nshared amongst the Americas. The emancipation of all men, though boldly \ndeclared by many nations throughout the nineteenth century, remains to \nbe realized. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution as a \nnecessary step in addressing the racial inequities that persist in \nNorth America, Latin America and the Caribbean.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. HASTINGS of Florida", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1544", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HCONRES", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "109", "number": "175"}], "doc_title": "ACKNOWLEDGING AFRICAN DESCENDANTS OF THE TRANSATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE IN ALL OF THE AMERICAS", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgE1544"}
