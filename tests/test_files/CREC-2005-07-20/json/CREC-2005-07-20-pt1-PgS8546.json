Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to explain \nmy recent action related to S. 1418, the Wired for Health Care Quality \nAct. Today, with great reluctance, I asked Leader Frist to consult with \nus prior to any action related to consideration of this bill, which the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee reported by voice vote \nthis morning.\n  The Wired for Health Care Quality Act would promote the use of \nelectronic health records by adopting standards for the electronic \nexchange of information, offer incentives for health care providers to \ncreate networks for secure exchange of electronic health information, \nand ensure quality measurement and reporting of provider performance \nunder the Public Health Service Act.\n  I fully support linking the adoption of health information technology \nto quality improvements in our health care system. They go hand in \nhand. Which is why Senator Baucus and I decided to introduce our \nMedicare Value Purchasing Act, S. 1356, jointly with Senators Enzi and \nKennedy's Better Healthcare Through Information Technology Act, S. \n1355. The thought behind a dual introduction was to enforce the message \nthat Medicare can drive quality improvement through payment incentives, \nand that the adoption of information technology is also a necessary \nstep not only to facilitate the reporting of quality measures but also \nto increase efficiency and quality in our health care delivery system.\n  Our bill creates quality payments under Medicare for all provider \ngroups. A considerable amount of time was devoted towards ensuring that \nthe development of quality measures and the implementation of value-\nbased purchasing programs under Medicare were properly vetted with \nprovider groups, beneficiary groups, and the administration. We did not \nwant to reinvent the wheel; we wanted to build on the initiatives that \nalready exist to develop and adopt quality measures. And because \nMedicare is the single largest purchaser of health care in the Nation, \nadopting quality payments in Medicare influences the level of quality \nin all of health care. We have seen time and time again how when \nMedicare leads, the other public and private purchasers follow.\n  Which is why I am troubled, that as currently drafted, S. 1418 would \nrequire the development of quality measures under the Public Health \nService Act. It is hard to comprehend how the quality measurement \nsystem in this bill intersects with the quality measurement system \ndeveloped in the Medicare Value Purchasing Act. The last thing we want \nto do is end up with two different quality measurement systems. This \nhas the potential to derail both proposals, effectively terminating or \nat least postponing the common goal of improving the quality of patient \ncare.\n  The Wired for Health Care Quality Act would also direct the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services, along with the Secretary of Defense, the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs, and other heads of relevant Federal \nagencies to jointly develop a quality measurement system. The \ncoordination among all these Federal agencies alone is a massive \nproject that could indefinitely stall the development and \nimplementation of appropriate quality measures or result in one that \nfalls to the lowest common denominator. That could actually set back \nquality efforts.\n  I welcome the opportunity to work with the sponsors of S. 1418, \nSenators Enzi, Kennedy, Frist, and Clinton along with members of the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on this matter. I had \nhoped to accomplish that before the bill was introduced on the floor. \nUnfortunately, that did not happen. I do not take actions such as these \nlightly. But I am deeply troubled that, as currently drafted, the Wired \nfor Health Care Quality Act could end up unintentionally delaying our \ncommon goal of improving the quality of health care for all Americans.", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GRASSLEY", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B000243", "text": "  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to address possible floor \nconsideration of S. 1418, a bill to amend the Public Health Service Act \nto enhance the adoption of a nationwide interoperable health \ninformation technology system and to improve the quality and reduce the \ncosts of health care in the United States.\n  Senator Grassley and I have been working since January with Senators \nEnzi and Kennedy on issues of quality and health information \ntechnology. Together, we introduced two bills on June 30--one that \ndeals with Medicare quality, and another to enhance quality through the \nwidespread adoption of health IT. The latter is S. 1356, the Medicare \nValue Purchasing Act of 2005, which develops a system of quality \nmeasurement and implements pay-for-performance in Medicare.\n  In drafting these two bills, we worked hard to craft language that \nwas complementary rather than contradictory. Ultimately, we viewed \nthese two pieces of policy as working together to build a comprehensive \nand workable health care quality system.\n  S. 1418 potentially disrupts the work we have done thus far, by \nincluding language that will force the duplication of quality \nmeasurement systems. It also raises questions about the jurisdictional \nreach of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Medicare is the dominant payer in health care, with annual spending \nexceeding $300 billion. Furthermore, it is Medicare's payment systems \nthat are often adopted by private insurance groups. Private payers use \nthe Medicare physician fee schedule for their own book of business, and \nwe would expect these same insurers to follow Medicare's lead on pay-\nfor-quality.\n  I appreciate the process that Senators Enzi and Kennedy have \nundertaken with us over the last several months. And I appreciate the \nmajority leader's desire to move important health IT legislation. \nCongressional action on this issue is long overdue. But until common \nground can be reached on a feasible system of measuring quality, I must \nreluctantly object to moving forward with S. 1418. I believe that the \nprocess outlined in this bill for the development of quality measures \nmay well be unworkable and that it will raise deep concerns for \nhospitals, physicians, and other providers.\n  I also believe that the language on the development of quality \nmeasures in this bill ought to be designed for Public Health Service \nAct programs and explicitly applicable to these programs, not to \nMedicare or Medicaid.\n  I hope that our colleague, Senators Enzi, Kennedy, Frist, and \nClinton, will work with us to craft a bill that is appropriate for \nprograms under the\n\n\nPHSA and that complements the Medicare Value Purchasing Act of 2005. \nUltimately, I believe that we have the same goals in mind. If we can \ncome to an agreement now, we can continue moving forward with these \nimportant policies that can change the shape, quality, and ultimately \nthe cost and benefit of our health care system.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. BAUCUS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "S8546-S8547", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "S", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "109", "number": "1355"}, {"type": "S", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "109", "number": "1355"}, {"type": "S", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "109", "number": "1356"}, {"type": "S", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "109", "number": "1356"}, {"type": "S", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "109", "number": "1418"}, {"type": "S", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "109", "number": "1418"}], "doc_title": "PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgS8546"}
