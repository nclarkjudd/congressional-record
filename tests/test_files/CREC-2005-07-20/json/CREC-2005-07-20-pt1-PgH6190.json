Mr. Speaker, I am so delighted to be here with my \nfriends and colleagues who also are very committed to strengthening \nSocial Security to make sure that it not only is strong and a viable \nprogram for current seniors and for those of us that are the baby \nboomers and about to retire, but also that it is a program that is \nsustainable and solvent for our children and our grandchildren.\n  That is a big challenge for us and it is easy today to put off \nproblems that look like they are going to be 2 years in the distance, 4 \nyears in the distance, 10 years in the distance, 25 years in the \ndistance, to take up just what is the most pressing challenge today; \nbut that is a wrong strategy. That strategy leaves our country \nvulnerable. In this case it gets worst the longer we fail to act.\n  I am pleased our President has discussed this with the American \npeople. He has been very forthright on what the challenges are, and he \nhas shared with the American people that doing nothing is the most \ndangerous thing we can do when it comes to Social Security. We all know \nSocial Security is a pay-as-you-go. Those that are currently working \nare paying for those that are currently retired.\n  It used to be that there were 16 workers in the workforce for every \nretiree. Later there were 10 workers in the workforce for every \nretiree. Today there are 3, and so that means that considerable \nresources, considerable dollars that current workers make have to go to \nsustain each retiree.\n  It is wonderful that we can anticipate longer lives than those who \ndesigned Social Security. In fact, it used to be that life expectancy \nwas 62 years, and you could retire when you were 65 years. So when \nSocial Security was first proposed and first passed, there were far \nmore people that paid into the system than would ever think that they \nwould get actual Social Security benefits because of the life \nexpectancy.\n  To our benefit and to the quality of our life, Americans are living \nfar longer. So we need to modernize Social Security so that we do not \nhave two or three workers in the system supporting every retiree as \nthey also have to support their families. We need to make sure that \nthose in the workforce that actually make sure that Social Security is \nsolvent, that when they retire, it is there for them. We need to act \nsooner rather than later because today it is still possible to deal \nwith the Social Security surplus, to put dollars aside, to build a \nsystem that will help make the system solvent and sustainable in later \nyears.\n  I have with me today one of my colleagues, the gentleman from Florida \n(Mr. Miller), who is very knowledgeable about Social Security and in \nparticular about the GROW accounts, the proposal before us right now as \nwe consider whether we take big steps or small steps towards personal \naccounts that can help us bridge the gap between a system that is not \nsustainable and not solvent to a system that is there for our children \nand grandchildren.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) and am eager to \nhear what he has to say.", "turn": 3, "speaker": "Mrs. NORTHUP", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M001144", "text": "  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I am sure it is no surprise to \nmany of you that some of my constituents do oppose personal retirement \naccounts, so when they do I ask them this very question: Would you \nagree or disagree Congress should have, when it created Social \nSecurity, set up a really true lockbox that earned interest on their \nFICA contributions?\n  Of course they eagerly agree that the money should have been set \naside and used only for Social Security benefits.\n  I then follow up with the question: Then why in the world would you \nbe opposed to a personal lockbox, if you will?\n\n\n  It is not secret here in Congress we have not had the discipline in \nmany instances to keep our hands out of the cookie jar of Social \nSecurity. Now to stop this I propose that in the future that Congress \ncannot get its hands on the money in the first place. As soon as \nworkers can start to save part of their Social Security money in a \npersonal retirement account, with their very name on it, this Congress \nwill have to find its money elsewhere.\n  Growing Real Ownership for Workers legislation is something that our \ncolleague, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. McCrery) introduced, that \nwould strictly use Social Security dollars for Social Security \nbenefits. Now these GROW accounts mandate that Social Security taxes be \nused for benefit payments to those people who have worked hard, who \nhave followed the rules and have earned the right to a secure \nretirement. The accounts would be created for workers under the age of \n55 unless they choose not to participate.\n\n\n  The current Social Security surplus would be dedicated to individual \nGROW accounts where it would be invested in guaranteed marketable \nTreasury securities, real assets that workers themselves would own and \non which account balances would, in fact, be inheritable. Workers age \n55 and older will continue to participate in the Social Security system \nthat we know today. Nothing changes. People should have the right if \nthey wish to invest their Social Security taxes in safe, diversified \nfunds like a Thrift Savings Plan that Federal employees and Members of \nCongress have. The return, in fact, has been proven to be better than \nthe government's 1.6 percent return on Social Security.\n  Younger workers should have the opportunity to receive a higher \nretirement income than the current system will be able to pay by the \ntime that they can retire themselves. Workers between the ages of 22 \nand 55 should have the option of joining the personal account system, \nand people younger than 22 could, in fact, be required to join that \nsystem. Those retiring after about 2042 can really expect to receive \nonly about 73 percent or less of what they are being promised today. A \nreasonable reform would allow them the opportunity to improve their \nretirement incomes by investing a portion of their current payroll \ntaxes.\n  The current system owes some $10.4 trillion more in promised benefits \nthan it can afford to pay, and each passing year adds an additional \n$600 million to the cost of permanently fixing the Social Security \nsystem. Benefits will be reduced and taxes may have to be raised.\n  As I have been visiting high school seniors in my district over the \nlast few months, I have entered into a dialogue with many of the \nstudents over the future of Social Security, and I have asked some \nstudents if they believe that Social Security will be around for them \nto collect when they retire. Out of the five classrooms, only one hand \nwas raised. That is one out of approximately 175 young adults around \nthe age of 18 who actually have faith in our current Social Security \nsystem.\n  Young adults are supportive of personal accounts because they \nunderstand that they will be better off during their retirement years. \nAnd they also realize that they will not have to worry about placing a \nfinancial burden on their children and grandchildren who would \notherwise have to act as a financial caretaker in their retirement \nyears.\n  I have received correspondence from my constituents 50 years and \nolder eagerly opposing the accounts due to a very common misconception. \nThe middle-aged and elderly residents in my area have a fear of not \nreceiving the benefits that they have been promised in the system. To \nthem I say this: they will receive their benefits just as promised. For \nthem the Social Security system will not change in any way.\n  However, I think it would be a disgrace to deny our younger \ngeneration and generations to come the opportunity to build a nest egg, \nif you will, and prepare adequately for their future. Many people ask \nwhat safeguards will the government have to protect these personal \naccounts if someone invests poorly or recklessly. Clearly, not everyone \nis comfortable in investing. So Social Security reform will have to \ninclude some type of safeguard for its participants in the personal \naccount system. Aside from the strong performance of financial markets \nover the long term, as well as the fact that a majority of your account \nwill remain in the Social Security trust fund as a safety net, the \npersonal accounts that will be offered will be fully diversified.\n  Another idea that has been talked about is having participants \npurchase an inflation-adjusted annuity that is at least equal to 100 \npercent of the poverty level for their retirement. Democrats have said \nthis: they think that we should eliminate the $90,000 cap on income. \nEven completely eliminating the cap on taxable wages would only \npostpone permanent deficits by 6 years, from 2018 to 2024. A temporary \nfix would likely require future generations to raise taxes over and \nover, and I think that our constituents deserve better than that.\n  Now more than ever, those of us here in Congress have a \nresponsibility to make the tough decision while not making the \nfinancial burden any harder on the American people. Voluntary personal \nretirement accounts are very beneficial for the workers and retirees of \nthe future. They would be accumulating money in their own account \nthroughout their working life. And that money would grow through \ninvestment over the years. Because their dollars are growing over the \ncourse of decades, they would be able to have a more comfortable \nretirement without relying entirely on the next generation of workers \ncoming after them.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think we all agree that we need to move towards change \nnow. Let us pass legislation that includes some type of personal \nretirement accounts. And as we talk about this issue tonight, again I \nwant to thank the gentlewoman from Kentucky (Mrs. Northup) for bringing \nthis issue forward. I look forward to the opportunity of conversing \nwith my other colleagues on the this very important issue.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. MILLER of Florida", "itemno": 5}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "N000143", "text": "  Mrs. NORTHUP.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me, \nand I thank her for her leadership on this issue.\n  This is one of many times she has come to the floor and spoken on \nthis very important issue that I think is important to generation of \nAmericans, and it is important that we focus on the facts and how we \ncan strengthen Social Security for the long term. And the gentleman \nfrom Florida did a tremendous job in talking about a first step, I \nthink a very appropriate step, in making sure that we preserve the \nSocial Security surplus for Social Security reasons and benefits.\n  I did 15 or 20 town hall meetings so far this year on Social \nSecurity; and if there was one message I heard loud and clear, Mr. \nSpeaker, from the people of\n\n\nthe Second District of Indiana it is: let us stop raiding the Social \nSecurity surplus. Let us stop spending it on everything from the \nCowgirl Hall of Fame to the war in Iraq. Let us use that surplus for \nwhat it is there for, and that is simply to provide the benefits for \nSocial Security beneficiaries in the future. And that is exactly what \nGROW accounts do. They simply stop the raid. I think facts matter, and \nwith anything I think that we should understand the facts before we \nmake decisions.\n  And I learned recently that there is going to be a group of people in \nmy district office in South Bend, Indiana tomorrow, and they are going \nto demand that I take my name off as a cosponsor of the bill that \ncreates GROW accounts. I am not going to take my name off of that bill \nbecause I think that their request is based on a misunderstanding of \nthe facts, and I know that because they sent me a letter, or they are \ngoing to deliver to me a letter tomorrow, I think, but we got an \nadvance copy, and some of the things they have stated in this letter \nare gross misstatements of the fact and I think mislead people as to \nwhat GROW accounts do and how they start to solve our Social Security \nproblem.\n  The first misunderstanding is they say that ``rather than ensuring \nthat American workers receive the benefits they have earned, this bill \nwould divert payroll contributions to create private accounts and would \nfund these private accounts using the `surplus,' money which has \nalready been earmarked to pay the baby boomers' Social Security \nbenefits.''\n  Mr. Speaker, it is true that this bill would create personal accounts \nand those personal accounts will be funded by surplus Social Security \nmoney that goes into the system that is not needed for current \nbeneficiaries. What is not true is that the surplus has been earmarked \nfor baby boomers in the future. In fact, the opposite is true. The \nsurplus is simply spent on everything that the government needs that is \noutside of Social Security benefits. So I think it is very important \nthat we understand that the GROW account simply makes sure that we \nspend Social Security surplus money on Social Security purposes.\n  The second misunderstanding is they say: ``This plan would cut \nguaranteed benefits.'' There are two things wrong with that statement. \nOne, there are no guaranteed benefits under Social Security as it is \ncurrently implemented. The Supreme Court has said that no one has a \nproperty right, no one has a right to your benefits. Congress can \nchange the Social Security system at any time in the future and no one \ncan make a claim for their benefits. So under the current Social \nSecurity plan, there are no guaranteed benefits.\n  But if we have GROW accounts, there is a guaranteed benefit because \nthat becomes a personal asset. That becomes an asset with their name on \nit. It becomes a part of their estate. It becomes inheritable if they \ndie before they can collect their benefits, and currently Social \nSecurity has none of those aspects and none of those benefits.\n  The third misunderstanding is: ``This plan would finance risky \nprivate accounts.'' Again, Mr. Speaker, it does fund personal accounts. \nIt is a personal asset for individuals who are in the Social Security \nsystem. But they are not risky because these accounts would simply have \none asset in them when they are created, and that is government-backed \nsecurities, government bonds, the safest investment in the world, and \nthese are tradeable and marketable bonds that can be sold at a later \ntime when people have their retirement needs, and they can use that for \ntheir retirement benefits.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I do think that facts really matter in this debate \nbecause the consequences are very important to every generation of \nAmericans.\n  We can talk more about these accounts and more about the Social \nSecurity situation overall, but again I want to thank my colleagues for \nbeing here tonight talking about this very important issue. And one of \nthe things that I always want to encourage people to do is to share \nwith us what they are for. The people coming to my office tomorrow are \ngoing to tell me what they are against. I would love to hear what their \nideas on saving Social Security are. I would love to hear what they are \nfor. I know that their colleagues are open minded and that we are \nwilling to listen to any good idea to make sure that we permanently \nsolve the problems that Social Security faces. So I hope that we can \nhave some positive input from both sides of the aisle and all the \nAmerican people because we need that to solve this problem.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mr. CHOCOLA", "itemno": 7}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "N000143", "text": "  Mrs. NORTHUP. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I would just like to \nask my friend from Indiana specifically about the concern that the \npeople coming to his office have about any sort of risk as though \ncurrent benefits are guaranteed and they are in place. As he said, they \nare not guaranteed. The fact is the Supreme Court has recognized that. \nMore importantly, we hear people on the floor every day talking about \neverything is fine until 2042 and then there would be a 25 percent cut \nin benefits, as though that is perfectly okay for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  But I would just like to ask the gentleman what he thinks of the 1993 \ntax bill that raised taxes on Social Security, both the percentage that \npeople pay, the percentage of tax, and the baseline that caused them to \nhave to start paying this tax, if he would not call that a reduction in \nbenefits. If previously those Social Security dollars that people got \nwere not taxed and the portion that was, was taxed at a lower rate, in \n1993 in one day, Congress changed the law to start taxing more of \npeople's Social Security dollars at a higher rate, if that was not the \ngovernment reducing their benefit.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mrs. NORTHUP", "itemno": 8}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "C001052", "text": "  Mr. CHOCOLA.

And if we \ninclude raising the amount of payroll that is subject to the tax, it is \nsomething like 38 or 39 times we have raised the contribution to the \nsystem.\n  What we have to do is find a way to permanently solve the Social \nSecurity challenges that are really undeniable. As she said, the only \nthing guaranteed is a significant cut in benefits in 2041 or 2042 if we \ndo nothing. So I think it is time that we find a way to permanently \nsolve this problem. The GROW accounts are a great idea as a first step. \nThey are not the total answer, but they are a first step to give people \nan ownership stake in Social Security, make sure that we use the \nsurplus for what it is intended for, and that is Social Security \nbenefits, stop raiding the surplus and begin to strengthen Social \nSecurity for the long term.", "turn": 10, "speaker": "Mr. CHOCOLA", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "N000143", "text": "  Mrs. NORTHUP.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me, \nand I appreciate the opportunity to have this discussion tonight, \nbecause, unfortunately, the American people are hearing a lot of \ndiatribe that really has no basis in fact regarding Social Security.\n  The gentlewoman mentioned earlier a point that needs to be stressed, \nand that is that people believe that Social Security is just fine, that \ntheir benefits that they expect are going to be paid, and that nothing \nis going to change. Unfortunately, that is just not the case.\n  As was mentioned also earlier, in 1983 there was a significant change \nin the law, and the reason they had to do that was because Social \nSecurity was not going to have enough money to pay out the benefits. So \nthe taxes did increase.\n  Now we are at another point where we are having a very serious change \nin our demographics, and that means that there are a lot more people \nwho are going to be receiving Social Security benefits in the coming \nyears. The good news is they are going to live a lot longer than they \nused to, but the bad news is that the Social Security money\n\n\nis not going to be enough to fund the benefits they expect.\n  Of course, another problem that Social Security has had for years and \none that the GROW Act of 2005, which several of my colleagues have \nmentioned, will help us fix, is that the money that comes into Social \nSecurity now is not even being spent on Social Security to a \nsignificant degree.\n  There is a surplus in the Social Security account for the next \nseveral years and that money should actually be saved for Social \nSecurity benefits. But right now it is not being saved for Social \nSecurity benefits. That money is being spent on general government \noperations, as my colleague from Indiana mentioned. It could be \nanything from some crazy museum or the war. But that money has been \ncollected for Social Security, so it should be spent there.\n  We need to stop the raid on Social Security. We need to stop spending \nthe surplus on things other than Social Security. One of the best \nproposals I have seen to do that is the GROW Act of 2005. It would not \nonly stop the raid, but it would give Social Security a different \ndimension that I think is important to Americans, especially in this \nday and age, and that is that it would set up personal accounts for \neach American in the Social Security system. That money would actually \nhave their name on it.\n  A lot of people think that the Social Security money they pay in goes \ninto an account with their name on it. But that is not the case. It \ngoes into the trust fund and gets spent on a number of things.\n  What the GROW Act would do is set up personal retirement accounts for \neach person in the Social Security system. Everybody who is paying in \ntaxes would have this account, and that money could no longer be spent \non other government operations. It would stay in Social Security. It \nwould be our money. It would have our name on it. It would be \ninheritable. It is not today, so if you die at 64 and you still have \nnot begun receiving your Social Security benefits, those benefits are \nlost and your family does not have any claim on those benefits.\n  So the GROW accounts would be created for anybody under 55, unless \nthey choose not to participate. Then they can stay in traditional \nSocial Security. So that Social Security surplus would be dedicated to \nthese GROW accounts and they would be invested in guaranteed, \nmarketable Treasury securities.\n  Another concern and some of the demagoguery we have heard is that you \ncan invest this money in something and lose it in the stock market. \nThat is what you hear, it is a risky investment.\n  These are marketable Treasury securities, not risky investments. They \nare real assets that are very conservative, in fact. Upon retirement, \nthese account balances would be used to help pay Social Security \nbenefits.\n  I mentioned that they are inheritable. I think this is worth \nstressing over and over again, because most people understand that they \ndo not have an ownership right in Social Security. But under the GROW \nAct, they would.\n  So I think there are a lot of things that are an advantage to people \nthat these proposals would really bring that they are not aware of; and \nas long as some of these groups, such as the ones in the district of \nthe gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Chocola), are out there, we really need \nto clear the record, to make it clear.\n  I serve on the Committee on Ways and Means. We have been looking at \nways to basically shore up Social Security, to make sure that the \nAmerican public will have an investment that they can depend upon for \ntheir retirement; something that will be real; something that will give \nthem a real ``bang for their buck'' as they invest it through their \nentire lives. And we know that investing it this way is just much \nsmarter. Every person who pays those taxes certainly wants to get the \nmost out of them that they can.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gentlewoman from Kentucky (Mrs. \nNorthup), I really appreciate the opportunity to join you tonight.", "turn": 12, "speaker": "Ms. HART", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "N000143", "text": "  Mrs. NORTHUP.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I would \nlike to discuss that a bit.\n  I think it was mentioned, the large amounts of money that are \ninvolved in Social Security, because everybody who is working is paying \ninto their Social Security fund. In fact, I think a lot of people do \nnot really realize how much they are paying in. They are paying this \ntax and their employer is paying the tax for them, as well, and it \ntotals 12 percent-plus of their income that is going into the Social \nSecurity fund. That is a lot of money.\n  If people could actually have control of that money, they could \ncertainly earn more on it through these investments, even in Treasury \nbills, but especially in different kinds of securities.\n  But the deficit, people talk about how we spend too much money. One \nof the ways, certainly, to prevent the Congress from spending too much \nmoney is to not give the Congress this extra money to spend. Because \nwhat has happened over the years is it has just become sort of an \nassumption that that money that is sitting there in the Social Security \nsurplus can be spent on whatever we want to spend it on. Unfortunately, \nthat creates a serious problem for us down the road, because we are not \ninvesting that money, because we are not getting a return on that money \nthat is going to help us pay Social Security benefits down the read.\n  So the idea of the GROW accounts, which would prevents us from \nspending that money, I think has a double benefit. It would tell the \nCongress, hey, this is not your money to spend, and you need to find \nways to get your spending in order; you need to get ahold of that and \nreview the programs and cut the programs that are not really doing \nanything for the American people. In fact, right now I am pleased to \nsay there have been well over 100 programs cut in this year's \nRepublican budget, which is very important.\n  We need to continue along that track. One of the ways to push us to \ncontinue along that track is to take the Social Security surplus and \nput it in a bunch of personal lockboxes like the GROW accounts would \nset up, so that every American will have confidence that there will be \nmoney there for them in Social Security, with their name on it, so we \nwill have that money for them when they need it when they retire.", "turn": 18, "speaker": "Ms. HART", "itemno": 19}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "N000143", "text": "  Mrs. NORTHUP.

So I thank \nthe gentlewoman very much for her thoughts on that.\n  I see that now my good friend, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nGingrey), is here. He has spent a lot of time talking about and \nstudying the issue of Social Security, is very knowledgeable about it; \nand I am eager to hear his thoughts on this issue tonight.", "turn": 19, "speaker": "Mrs. NORTHUP", "itemno": 20}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000550", "text": "  Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Kentucky for \nnot only recognizing me for a few minutes, but for putting together \nthis special hour to discuss something that is so important.\n  As I went across my district, and I know my colleagues did the same \nthing, talking about Social Security when the President first rolled \nout his suggestion of having an individual personal account, it was not \njust his idea, but I think a very good idea, to carve out up to 4 \npercent of the 12.4 percent payroll tax in an optional way for those \nworkers under 55, and to let that part of their Social Security account \nbe an account that they actually own, they actually have ownership of, \nand it could enjoy the miracle of compound interest. Einstein said that \nwas the greatest power in the world, even more powerful than atomic \nfission. But clearly that was a good idea. I think it is still a good \nidea.\n  But as I talked about that in my town hall meetings across the \nEleventh District of Georgia, Mr. Speaker, the one recurring theme that \nI heard from folks, mostly seniors in the audience, but a lot of times \nthey were younger workers, they said, Congressman, we are not sure \nabout this individual personal account thing.\n  I think people are afraid of change, and they would express a little \nbit of hesitation and doubt about it. But one thing that seemed \nconsistent almost every time I did a town hall meeting, and I think I \nprobably have done at least 15 on this subject, was whatever you do, \nCongressman, please, go back to Washington and tell your colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle that this business of robbing, of raiding that \ntrust fund has got to stop. If you do not do anything else, just solve \nthat problem, because nothing else really matters if you continue to \ntake this excess money that has been coming in since 1935 when we had \n15 workers for every beneficiary and people died before they reached \nthe age at which they could earn a benefit at age 65. Life expectancy \nwas 64 on average, and we did not have any problem.\n\n\n  But we have time over these coming years. I say ``we,'' and my \ncolleague pointed out just a little earlier, we were not around, not \nmany of us, I think I was 3 years old when Franklin Delano Roosevelt \ndied. But Congresses have been spending that excess money in the so-\ncalled trust fund to the point that $1.7 trillion is missing.\n  But I think it is important for us, my colleagues, to let the \nAmerican people know that that money was not squandered, it was not \nwasted. We are not talking about fraud and abuse; we are talking about \nspending money on things like K through 12 education, Head Start \nprograms, benefits for our veterans, which they so richly deserve, in \ntimes like we are now when we are in a shooting war and we have to \nequip our troops to make sure that we give them every opportunity to \nwin. That is where the money has gone.\n  I think Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle are, by their \nvery nature, compassionate. And when these folks come to us and say, we \nneed just a little bit more, Mr. Congressman and Mrs. Congresswoman, we \nneed just a little bit more, we have little children that have needs, \nwe have disabled people that have needs, that is where the trust fund \nhas gone.\n  So I think it is understandable. We can play this blame game and \nfinger point and say, well, the Democrats did this, or President \nClinton, or the Republicans have spent the money, or President Bush is \nspending the money to wage a war in Iraq and Afghanistan. But what we \nare talking about now with this idea of the GROW account is to answer \nthe complaint of the people in the 11th district of Georgia, and I am \nsure my colleagues' districts as well, let us do finally put a lockbox \non the Social Security Trust Fund.\n  So I really commend the members of the Committee on Ways and Means, \nthe gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. McCrery), the gentleman from Florida \n(Mr. Shaw), the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sam Johnson), the gentleman \nfrom Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Shadegg), \nand my colleagues here tonight, the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. \nHart) and, before that, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Chocola) was \nwith us. I think the Committee on Ways and Means has really come up \nwith a novel idea. I hope we will not abandon the thought of individual \npersonal accounts coming out of the payroll tax, and I think at some \npoint we will do that, and we need to continue to work on the solvency \nof Social Security.\n  But this is a great way, these GROW accounts, to say that we are \ngoing to take the excess, and there will be, Mr. Speaker, an excess of \nrevenue coming in over benefits being paid out from now until 2017. I \ndo not think anybody disagrees with that. I think one of my colleagues \ntonight said that we are talking about maybe as much as $700 billion \nover that period of time before we reach that cross-over where the \namount coming in is the same as the amount going out. But we have got \nthat window of opportunity, we are talking about 12 years, where we can \nallocate that money, that excess money to individuals younger than age \n55, unless they opt out, and then in 2009, as I understand the GROW \naccounts, we will actually not only have the opportunity to invest that \ninto government bonds, but put it in a well-managed Thrift Savings Plan \nso that our beneficiaries can then enjoy the miracle of compound.\n  So I am really glad to be here tonight to lend my thoughts to it. I \nthink it is\n\n\na great idea. I commend the committee. I look forward to having the \nopportunity to go back home during the August recess and tell my \ncolleagues that yes, we are finally going to respond to the best \nsuggestion that I have heard, and it was from the folks back home; let \nus finally put a lockbox on the excess dollars coming in.\n  With that, I will yield back to the gentlewoman from Kentucky and \nthank her for letting me participate this evening.", "turn": 20, "speaker": "Mr. GINGREY", "itemno": 21}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "N000143", "text": "  Mrs. NORTHUP. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I think he \nraises a point that is important.\n  Many nights we have talked about personal savings accounts and how \nmany of us believe that in the long run they are the best answer to \nsolvency, to making sure that our younger workers have a system that is \nthere for them, that gives them a good return on investment, a system \nwhere as Americans live longer they can count on these dollars in their \nretirement.\n  But that is not possible today. It is not possible for a variety of \nreasons. Part of it is politics, part of it is all of the scare tactics \nthat are being used. But, more importantly, sometimes, when you have a \nvery big, complicated problem, it is easier if you solve it in steps, \nand the first step that Americans seem to be asking us to do is stop \nmaking the problem worse by spending the Social Security surplus on \nother things other than Social Security.\n  I think that is very exciting. When we do that, and I am convinced we \nwill do that, we are going to see that seniors are going to keep \ngetting their Social Security check just like they always have; we are \ngoing to see that younger workers are going to find out each year what \nthey have in a personal account for themselves that is going to grow. \nMany families, especially young families that are trying to balance \nchildren and new jobs and so forth, this may be the only savings that \nthey have from one year to the next, and that will be reassuring. And \nas people understand how that works, I am convinced that the support \nand the interest in growing that to truly solving the Social Security \nsystem will be there.\n  I know that my friend, the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart) \nalso has talked before about the hole we are in, if we do nothing, and \nwhy we have to deal with this problem now. I think it is important that \nthe gentlewoman add that to the record of our discussion tonight.", "turn": 21, "speaker": "Mrs. NORTHUP", "itemno": 22}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H001033", "text": "  Ms. HART. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I will \nbe brief. I think it is important for us to understand the absolute \nsize of this problem if we do not do anything. Because again, GROW \naccounts are the beginning of a solution to the problem of making sure \nthat there are benefits that are going to be able to be paid to people \nwho are expecting Social Security.\n  Right now we just cannot make that statement. We cannot tell people \nwe are going to make sure all of your benefits are paid because, in \nfact, in 2041, the trust funds will be gone. At that point, the payroll \ntaxes will be paid out as they come in and will only cover 74 percent \nof the benefits. A couple of years later, it declines to a much lower \npercentage, in the 60 percent range, and lower and lower. Obviously, \npeople do not want to receive less in their Social Security check.\n  So we are in a position where we need to identify and really realize \nthat we have a serious unfunded liability, the gap between program \nrevenues, things that are coming in, and the costs that we know that we \nwill have to pay. It is like a pension plan that is going bankrupt.\n  After considering the trust fund's current balance of about $1.7 \ntrillion, which is the unfunded liability, the cost of the program \nwould be $4 trillion in present value. That is $300 billion more than \nlast year's report. So the longer we wait to try to change the system, \nthe more it is going to cost to change the system and find a way to \nGROW accounts, and this GROW account bill will help us find a way to \nfill in that unfunded liability.\n  So the promise to maintain those benefits for people is really an \nempty promise until we make a change.\n  We have an opportunity from now until 2017 to start real accounts \nwith real money in them for the American public.\n  I really thank the gentlewoman from Kentucky (Mrs. Northup) for \nbringing this to the attention of the American people, because they \nneed to spend some time and understand this issue so that they can \nsupport these good proposals that are out there.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, \nand I especially thank her for her leadership.\n  Retirement security and saving Social Security is truly a critical \nissue in America. To me, this is much more than a simple congressional \ndebate; this is a debate that I take very personally. Mr. Speaker, my \nparents are in their seventies. Social Security is part of their \nretirement, a very important part of their retirement security, and not \nonly as a United States Congressman, but as a son, I am committed to \nensuring that they receive every single dollar that Social Security \nsays that they will receive. I have a moral obligation to my parents, \nand I know everybody in Congress feels that same obligation.\n  But not only do I feel I have a moral obligation to my parents, I am \nalso a father. I have a 3\\1/2\\-year-old daughter. I have a 22-month-old \nson. Social Security as we know it will not be there for them unless we \nact.\n  I can understand how different people in this body can have different \nsolutions to the problems that we are facing in Social Security, but I \ncannot believe those who would simply deny the existence of the \nproblem.\n  Mr. Speaker, I guess the challenge is, because too often in this town \nwe are looking to the next election and we are not looking to the next \ngeneration. I guess there is some good news, and we are talking about \nit tonight. Social Security is still running a surplus today. That is \ngood news. Those who are on Social Security, those who will soon be on \nSocial Security, they are going to be in fine shape, Mr. Speaker. But \nit is those future generations, it is for everybody in America who may \nhave that 3\\1/2\\-year-old daughter, that 22-month-old son, for whom we \nhave to do something.\n  Now, as much as we would like in Congress to repeal the laws of \ndemographics, we simply cannot do it. We cannot deny the fact that when \nSocial Security was first created, you had almost 50 workers paying \ninto the system for every one person taking out of the system. Now, Mr. \nSpeaker, we are down to only 3 and a third workers, 3 and a third \nworkers paying into a system for every one that is taking out. Very \nsoon, we are going to be down to 2 workers paying into the system for \nevery one.\n  Another demographic trend that we cannot outlaw, it is great for \nseniors, not too good for Social Security, is the average life span in \nAmerica is increasing. When Social Security was first created, the \naverage life span of an American was 60 years of age. I mean, their \nname was called on the roll up yonder before they ever saw one penny of \ntheir retirement. That is what many Americans faced. Well, thanks to \nthe marvels of modern medicine, which my colleague, the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Dr. Gingrey) knows a lot about, the average life span of an \nAmerican today is 77 years of age.\n  So we have more and more retirees, we have fewer and fewer workers, \nand those retirees are living longer and longer and longer, and the \nsystem simply cannot handle that. I mean, right now the cost of doing \nnothing is tremendous. We are looking right now at a shortfall in \nSocial Security of $10.4 trillion.\n\n\n  Now, I am not sure if anybody in America can really conceptualize or \ngrasp this figure of $10.4 trillion, trillion with a T. But I did a \nlittle math and what that means, Mr. Speaker, is if we wanted to try to \nsolve the problem of Social Security for future generations and solve \nit today, every American would have to write a check out for $34,000; a \nfamily of four over $125,000, to try to solve the problem today.\n  Now, what happens if we do nothing? And unfortunately, many of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle are part of the school of \nthought that we should do nothing. Well, if you look very closely at \nwhat the Social Security law says today, what current law says, what it \nreally says is that my children are going to face an automatic benefit \ncut of probably over a third. Now, when I go to town hall meetings in \nmy congressional district back in Texas and ask how many people are on \nSocial Security and maybe half of them raise their hands, I ask, how \nmany of you would be willing to take a third cut of our Social Security \nbenefits? Not one hand goes up. And then I ask, well, how about your \ngrandchildren? Do you mind if they have their benefits cut by a third? \nNot a single hand goes up.\n  Current law says, when the trust fund is exhausted, there will be an \nautomatic benefit cut, and it can approach one-third. Mr. Speaker, that \nis just not fair. I mean, this is an issue of generational fairness.\n  I would love for us to solve the problem of Social Security tonight. \nEvery day we put it off, it is costing the American people an extra \n$200 million. We are kicking that can down the road, because too many \npeople are looking at that next election and not the next generation. \nSo as much as I would like to solve the problem tonight, I know perhaps \nthat is not realistic.\n\n\n  But surely, Mr. Speaker, surely we can agree that the trust funds in \nSocial Security ought to be dedicated to Social Security. But that is \nnot the case. Forty-nine different times Congress has taken that money, \nand they spend it for something else.\n  Now, sometimes they spend it for really good things. They spend it on \nKevlar vests for our troops in Iraq. Maybe they spend it to help \nguarantee a student loan. Maybe they help a low-income person get into \ntheir first home.\n  But more often than not, they also spend it on wheelchairs for \nMedicare that cost five times as much as those in the VA. They spend it \non $800,000 outhouses in Iowa, and the toilet does not even flush. They \nspend it on studies of how and why college students decorate their \ndorm, and the list goes on and on and on.\n  There is a spending problem in Washington, D.C., Mr. Speaker, and we \nneed to make sure that the Social Security trust funds are solely \ndedicated to Social Security. And so, fortunately, a number of our \ncolleagues came up with an idea.\n  They call them GROW accounts, and it is a very, very simple idea. It \nsays, take the remaining Social Security surpluses, and we think maybe \nwe have about 12 years left before Social Security begins to go \nbankrupt. If the tidal wave of red ink only gets larger and larger and \nlarger, let us at least save the surpluses we have and let us get it \nout of Washington because Washington has been taking that money and \nspending it on something else.\n  Let us get it into your account, an account with your name on it, \nsomething that you own. And, Mr. Speaker, a lot of people in America do \nnot realize that they do not own their own Social Security. Several \nSupreme Court cases have ruled you do not own your own Social Security. \nSo this is a very simple idea. Surely, we in Congress can at least \nagree on this one small baby step, to try to keep the security in \nSocial Security. Let us take these remaining surpluses, let us put them \ninto an account that you own, that Congress cannot spend, that \nbureaucrats cannot take away. You own it, something that you can leave \nto your family. Put it in a very safe investment, put it into a T-Bill.\n  Now, I do not know how anybody, Mr. Speaker, can call this a risky \nproposition, but they do. Let me tell you what is really risky. What is \nreally risky is Americans leaving their retirement security here in \nWashington, D.C. when the trust fund has been raided 49 different \ntimes.\n  Mr. Speaker, there have been 20 different tax increases on Social \nSecurity, 20 different tax increases. And every time that the taxes are \nincreased, your rate of return goes down. And that is important because \nwe are losing the security out of Social Security.\n  Now, my grandparents, who are deceased, who were born about 1900, \nthey got about a 12 percent rate of return on their Social Security. \nThat was a great rate of return. My parents, who I alluded to earlier \nthis evening, they were born in roughly 1930. They are getting about a \n4\\1/2\\ percent rate of return on their Social Security, and that is not \nbad. My generation, represented by those born roughly 1960, we are \ngoing to get about 2\\1/2\\ percent rate of return on our Social \nSecurity. That is barely keeping pace with inflation. And my children, \nmy children, my 3\\1/2\\-year-old daughter, my 22-month-old son, Mr. \nSpeaker, they are going to get a negative rate of return. They are \ngoing to put more money into Social Security than they take out.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is not fair. That is where the risk is. The risk is \ndoing nothing. The risk is leaving our Social Security here. There have \nbeen multiple benefit cuts in Social Security. We cannot have the trust \nfund raided. The tax increases, the benefit cuts, the declining rates \nof return, the no ownership rights. Surely we can agree on this modest \nstep forward of setting up these GROW accounts so that Americans can \ncount on that Social Security so the trust fund cannot be raided and we \ncan have personal accounts with your name on it. And, Mr. Speaker, that \nwould be one positive step that we could take in this body to help save \nSocial Security for future generations.", "turn": 24, "speaker": "Mr. HENSARLING", "itemno": 25}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "N000143", "text": "  Mrs. NORTHUP. I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling), who \nis a good friend. I also thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey) \nand the other Members that joined us tonight to talk about this very, \nvery important issue.\n  You talk so much about the different generations. It is amazing how \nmany people that are concerned about Social Security solvency think \nabout this in terms of all the different generations. I often picture \nthe generations sort of lined up, my mom and dad, my dad passed this \nyear, but my mom. She is 82, and she is sort of up at the front of the \nline. And then you get back, as people age, and I am 57 and so I am \nback still on this side of the line of retirement, eight steps away \nfrom retirement. My children in their 30s and 20s are further behind me \nin the line.\n  And the way Social Security works is everybody in the back of the \nline, before they get to retirement, helps pay the retirement for those \nat the front of the line. The problem is the line in the back is \ngetting shorter as the line in the front is getting longer. What GROW \naccounts do is allow younger workers in a sense to throw over the line \nsome savings that will be there when they get there. It saves the \npeople behind them in the line from having to fully fund their \nretirement, and it gives them the confidence that there will be a \nretirement savings for them.\n  It begins to change from of a pay-as-you-go system to a long-term \nfunded solvent system that will take care of Americans today, Americans \ntomorrow, and Americans in the future, so that our whole country will \nbe solvent and able to address the emerging challenges that are bound \nto emerge with each generation. It is the right thing to do. It is the \nfair thing to do. It is a good idea for a transition to go through the \nGROW accounts so that we can set up a system that helps us transform \nSocial Security from a pay-as-you-go to an invested solvent system.\n  I would like to thank my friends and colleagues who joined us late \ntonight to discuss this important issue.
