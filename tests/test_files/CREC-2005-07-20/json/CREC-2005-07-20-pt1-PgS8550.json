A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to the United \n     States Department of Agriculture (USDA) providing assistance, \n     including additional emergency funding, in the effort to \n     mitigate the infestation of the Emerald Ash Borer; to the \n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                          Senate Resolution 35\n\n       Whereas, Michigan asked the federal government for $29.5 \n     million to fight the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) in 2005. On \n     April 19th the USDA sent a letter to Governor Granholm saying \n     there would be no more emergency funding to fight the EAB. \n     The state has received only about $10.9 million from USDA, \n     which is not enough to fund all the current eradication \n     strategies; and\n       Whereas, With alarming swiftness, the Emerald Ash Borer, an \n     aggressive Asian insect, is threatening virtually all of the \n     ask trees in the state of Michigan and surrounding region. In \n     spite of the quarantine in 20 Michigan counties this beetle \n     has killed or damaged approximately 15 million ask tress in \n     the state. Overall, the EAB, an invasive species, is causing \n     similar devastation in the states of Ohio and Indiana, as \n     well as the Canadian province of Ontario, threatening as many \n     of 700 million ash trees in our state and 8 million in North \n     America; and\n       Whereas, Ash trees are very important to the ecology, \n     economy, and environment of our state and the nation. Ash \n     trees are used for many products in several sectors of \n     business. Beyond these factors, the ash trees that grace our \n     communities and neighborhoods are beloved shade trees that \n     contribute enormously to the character and beauty of \n     Michigan, the region, and the nation; and\n       Whereas, Governor Granholm is working to secure continued \n     assistance from the federal government to deal swiftly with \n     this devastating pest. Michigan needs sustained technical and \n     financial assistance to face this emergency. The state has \n     taken decisive actions to address this invasive species, but \n     the magnitude of the problem and the immediacy of the issues \n     make it clear we need the prompt assistance of Congress and \n     the USDA: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States and the United States Department of \n     Agriculture (USDA) to provide assistance, including \n     additional emergency funding, in the effort to mitigate the \n     infestation of the Emerald Ash Borer; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.", "kind": "Unknown", "speaker": "Unknown", "itemno": 0, "turn": -1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n\n       POM-143. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to \n     providing the necessary funding to restore Calcasieu Ship \n     Channel in southwest Louisiana in order that the economic, \n     safety, and security concerns may be adequately addressed; to \n     the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 12\n\n       Whereas, the Calcasieu Ship Channel, located in southwest \n     Louisiana, consists of thirty-five inland miles of navigable \n     waterway and thirty miles of offshore channel in the Gulf of \n     Mexico with a project depth of forty feet; and\n       Whereas, two major refineries are completely dependent on \n     the ship channel for crude oil supply, which is significant \n     since these refineries produce four percent of the supply of \n     motor fuels for the United States and have no alternate means \n     of receiving crude oil imports; and\n       Whereas, the Calcasieu Ship Channel also hosts the largest \n     liquified natural gas import terminal in the continental \n     United States, which is undergoing an expansion to double its \n     capacity, and additional receiving terminals have been \n     proposed on the Calcasieu, one of which has been approved by \n     the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC); and\n       Whereas, the Port of Lake Charles handles over fifty \n     million tons of cargo per year, making it the nation's \n     twelfth largest port; and\n       Whereas, with an abundance of environmentally sensitive, \n     potentially combustible cargo combined with a lack of viable \n     alternative transportation modalities suggests that loss of \n     this critical transportation infrastructure would be \n     economically and strategically devastating; and\n       Whereas, for the congressional Fiscal Year 2006, operating \n     and maintenance funding of the Calcasieu Ship Channel was cut \n     disproportionately in comparison to other ports and \n     waterways; and\n       Whereas, the Calcasieu Ship Channel cannot be maintained at \n     its project depth at forty feet of draft under the proposed \n     budget for Fiscal Year 2006 and will be functionally impaired \n     as a result; such consequences to include:\n       (1) Increased risk of a grounding in an environmentally \n     sensitive estuary that is not protected by a levee system.\n       (2) Increase in the number of tanker ship transits of \n     liquefied natural gas and crude oil, which in turn will \n     compound the need for future dredging and maintenance.\n       (3) Increase in shipping costs to users of the ship channel \n     resulting from the mandatory lightening of ships, eventually \n     borne by consumers.\n       (4) Increase in the number of transits of hazardous and \n     combustible cargoes directly increases the number of \n     potential terrorist targets on the channel.\n       (5) Should the channel be closed due to a grounding, four \n     percent of the nation's motor fuel supply will be cut off \n     from the raw materials needed for its production: Therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to provide the necessary \n     funding to the Calcasieu Ship Channel in southwest Louisiana \n     in order that the economic, safety, and security concerns may \n     be adequately addressed. Be it further\n       Resolved, That to adequately address these concerns \n     presented by under-funding, the Calcasieu Ship Channel needs \n     fifteen million dollars in annual maintenance funding and an \n     additional one-time allocation of another fifteen million \n     dollars to restore the channel to its authorized dimensions. \n     Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n\n       POM-144.

Hackworth's third \n     nomination for the Medal of Honor for his heroism in battle \n     while in the service of his country.

A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Tennessee relative to proposed cuts in \n     agriculture-related programs and initiatives; to the \n     Committee on the Budget.\n\n                      Senate Joint Resolution 277\n\n       Whereas, agriculture has been the backbone of the American \n     way of life since the founding of our great nation and even \n     today the United States of America remains the breadbasket of \n     the world; and\n       Whereas, recognizing that farm planning is a multi-year \n     process, the 2002 Farm Bill enacted by Congress provided a \n     long-term commitment to the American farming and ranching \n     communities to ensure stability in the agriculture industry \n     and the overall agriculture economy; and\n       Whereas, the structure and funding levels of the current \n     farm bill are currently being threatened with budget cuts \n     that will jeopardize the futures of America's farmers and \n     ranchers, placing them at a serious competitive disadvantage \n     during World Trade Organization's agriculture trade talks; \n     and\n       Whereas, agricultural products are America's top export \n     with more than $62 billion in sales during 2004. Farm exports \n     enable jobs and businesses for millions of Americans; more \n     than 17 percent of the total American workforce is involved \n     in the production, processing, and sale of the nation's food \n     and fiber; and\n       Whereas, Tennessee ranks fourth in the nation in the number \n     of farms within our borders; and agriculture contributes \n     $38.5 billion to the Tennessee economy and accounts for more \n     than 214,000 jobs; and\n       Whereas, the economic well-being of Tennessee's \n     agricultural producers directly contributes to the economic \n     well-being of the state as a whole and, in turn, the economic \n     health of our producers is dependent on the preservation of \n     agricultural funding on a national level.

A joint resolution adopted by the Assembly of the \n     State of Nevada relative to taking certain actions concerning \n     wilderness areas and wilderness study areas; to the Committee \n     on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 1\n\n       Whereas, The provisions of 16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq., commonly \n     referred to as the Wilderness Act, establish the National \n     Wilderness Preservation System, which consists of areas of \n     federal public lands that are designated by Congress as \n     wilderness areas; and\n       Whereas, Congress has designated approximately 2.8 million \n     acres of federal public lands in Nevada as wilderness areas; \n     and\n       Whereas, If an area of federal public land is designated as \n     a wilderness area, it must be managed in a manner that \n     preserves the wilderness character of the area and ensures \n     that the area remains unimpaired for future use and enjoyment \n     as a wilderness area; and\n       Whereas, A reasonable amount of wilderness area in this \n     State provides for a diverse spectrum of recreational \n     opportunities in Nevada, promotes tourism and provides a \n     place for Nevadans to escape the pressures of urban growth; \n     and\n       Whereas, The provisions of the Wilderness Act and the \n     Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 43 U.S.c. \n     1701 et seq., provide for the study of certain areas of land \n     to determine whether those areas, commonly known as \n     wilderness study areas, are suitable for designation as a \n     wilderness area; and\n       Whereas, In conjunction with the provisions of the \n     Wilderness Act and the Federal Land Policy and Management \n     Act, the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the \n     Interior in the late 1970s conducted an initial inventory of \n     approximately 49 million acres of federal public lands in \n     Nevada to determine the suitability of such lands for \n     designation as wilderness areas or identification as \n     wilderness study areas and, in 1980, recommended that \n     approximately 5.1 million acres of those lands be identified \n     as wilderness study areas; and\n       Whereas, Although Congress recently enacted the Lincoln \n     County Conservation, Recreation, and Development Act of 2004, \n     Pub. L. No. 108-424, 118 Stat. 2403, pursuant to which \n     approximately 768,000 acres have been given status as \n     wilderness areas and approximately 251,000 acres have been \n     released for multiple use under the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act, the Bureau of Land Management continues to \n     manage approximately 2.8 million acres of federal public \n     lands in Nevada identified as wilderness study areas; and\n       Whereas, Decisions concerning whether to designate \n     wilderness study areas as wilderness areas or release those \n     areas for multiple use are important and must be made in a \n     timely manner and without any unnecessary delays so that \n     those lands which are suitable for designation as a \n     wilderness an:a may be afforded full protection as such and \n     those lands which are not suitable for designation as a \n     wilderness area may be released for use and management for \n     the public good as accorded by law; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the members of the Nevada Legislature urge the \n     Nevada Congressional Delegation to work with all interested \n     Nevadans, land managers, affected parties, local governments, \n     special interest organizations and members of the public in a \n     spirit of cooperation and mutual respect to address issues \n     concerning the designation of wilderness areas in Nevada; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the members of the Nevada Legislature urge \n     Congress to take the following actions concerning wilderness \n     areas and wilderness study areas:\n       1. As part of the legislative process for determining which \n     federal lands should be designated as wilderness areas, and \n     in accordance with stakeholder agreements, continue the \n     policy of releasing federal lands that are a part of a \n     wilderness study area for multiple use, and to continue the \n     appropriate disposal of suitable federal lands for conversion \n     to state or private lands, when the determination is made \n     that those federal lands are unsuitable for designation as \n     wilderness areas;\n       2. When determining whether to designate land as a \n     wilderness area, carefully consider the requirements of \n     existing and future military operations on the land and in \n     the airspace over the land and make appropriate decisions \n     based on those requirements; and\n       3. Support the adoption of a schedule for the timely \n     consideration of a plan to release wilderness study areas \n     that are found unsuitable for designation as wild,erness \n     areas; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and each member of \n     the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 7}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n\n       POM-150.

Bush signed into law \n     H.R. 2937, which transferred 2,880 acres of federal land to \n     Clark County for the purpose of constructing a public \n     shooting park; and\n       Whereas, The Clark County Board of Commissioners directed \n     the Department of Parks and Community Services, with the \n     advice of a citizen advisory committee, to design, construct \n     and operate the shooting park; and\n       Whereas, The Sport Shooting Park Citizen Advisory Committee \n     has recommended a conceptual plan for a safe, affordable and \n     self-sustaining sport shooting park to meet the needs of the \n     public, and this project enjoys strong support from the \n     residents of the Las Vegas Valley; and\n       Whereas, The Department of the Interior, using money \n     generated from the sale of land in Las Vegas Valley as \n     required by the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act, \n     funded the first phase of this project; and\n       Whereas, The Clark County staff proposed that the federal \n     Parks, Trails and Natural Areas Subgroup recommend funding of \n     $42,160,000 by the Department of the Interior to complete the \n     remainder of the Sport Shooting Park development, as phases 2 \n     and 3 of the project; and\n       Whereas, The Parks, Trails and Natural Areas Subgroup \n     funding recommendation eliminated the proposed law \n     enforcement area and the park center, thereby reducing the \n     funding recommendation to $33,600,000; and\n       Whereas, The Clark County Board of Commissioners passed a \n     resolution on March 1, 2005, requesting a reevaluation of the \n     recommendation and the continuation of funding from the \n     Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act of 1998; and\n       Whereas, The Secretary of the Interior has the authority to \n     authorize expenditure of money from the Act to provide full \n     funding for the Clark County Sport Shooting Park: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the members of the 73rd Session of the Nevada \n     Legislature hereby urge President Bush to direct the \n     Secretary of the Interior to provide full funding for the \n     Clark County Sport Shooting Park; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the members of the 73rd Session of the \n     Nevada Legislature support the resolutions adopted by the \n     Clark County Board of Commissioners on March 1, 2005, \n     concerning the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act of \n     1998; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, the Vice President of the United States as the \n     presiding officer of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives, the Secretary of the Interior, \n     and each member of the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 8}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n\n       POM-151. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to \n     establishing a domestic energy policy that will ensure an \n     adequate supply of energy and the necessary infrastructure; \n     to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 120\n\n       Whereas, the price of natural gas in the United States, the \n     highest in the industrial world, has recently spiked and \n     continues to show volatility; and\n       Whereas, the current price of natural gas has been equated \n     to paying sixteen dollars for a gallon of milk, twelve \n     dollars and seventy cents for a pound of ground beef, or nine \n     dollars and twenty-one cents for a gallon of gasoline; and\n       Whereas, abnormally high natural gas prices have created an \n     unanticipated burden of one hundred and eleven billion \n     dollars on the economy of the United States over the past \n     thirty months; and\n       Whereas, the United States relies too heavily on natural \n     gas in our national energy supply, creating a tremendous \n     imbalance between natural gas supply and demand; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana's manufacturers, farmers, small \n     businesses, local governments, retailers, and residential \n     consumers are struggling from skyrocketing natural gas \n     prices; and\n       Whereas, thousands of jobs in these industries are \n     threatened because many of these businesses use natural gas \n     as a raw material and as an energy supply; and\n       Whereas, the natural gas imbalance is not a free market \n     problem; and\n       Whereas, natural gas is domestically produced and very \n     difficult to import, and the United States cannot correct the \n     imbalance by the importation of natural gas; and\n       Whereas, the high price of natural gas is created by \n     governmental policies that increase demand for natural gas \n     while impeding the development of a greater supply by \n     discouraging exploration and production; and\n       Whereas, the Legislature of Louisiana supports a sound and \n     rational domestic energy policy; and\n       Whereas, such energy policy should develop a concerted \n     national effort to promote greater energy efficiency and open \n     promising new areas for environmentally responsible natural \n     gas production: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to establish a domestic \n     energy policy that will ensure an adequate supply of energy \n     and the necessary infrastructure.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada relative to recognizing the unsuitability \n     of Yucca Mountain as the site for a repository to store and \n     dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive \n     waste; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                      Assembly Joint Resolution 4\n\n       Whereas, Since 1954, when the Atomic Energy Act was passed \n     by Congress, the Federal Government has been responsible for \n     the disposal of radioactive waste, yet few environmental \n     challenges have proven more daunting than the problems posed \n     by the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level \n     radioactive waste; and\n       Whereas, In July 2002, despite seemingly inadequate \n     standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency and the \n     recommendation of the Secretary of Energy, President Bush \n     signed legislation designating Yucca Mountain as suitable for \n     the nation's only repository for high-level radioactive waste \n     and spent nuclear fuel without regard to the constant and \n     vigorous objections of the political leaders and residents of \n     the State of Nevada, and ignored the underlying geologic \n     isolation requirements set by Congress; and\n       Whereas, The recommendation of Yucca Mountain was not only \n     premature but also flawed, especially given the Department of \n     Energy's failure to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the \n     socioeconomic, environmental and public health and safety \n     impact both within Nevada and within communities along \n     national shipping routes; and\n       Whereas, Not only is the proposed repository in one of the \n     most geologically active areas in the nation but, according \n     to the Agency for Nuclear Projects, it is ``the only \n     repository under consideration in the world that is located \n     above the water table, not below it''; and\n       Whereas, Even if risks related to geologic disposal are \n     ignored, the designation of Yucca Mountain is of particular \n     concern because of its location within an area rife with \n     seismic and hydrothermic activity and because of its \n     proximity to numerous fractures and earthquake faults, which \n     could lead to underground contamination; and\n       Whereas, As more, problems are revealed, the Department of \n     Energy has gravitated from the concept of geologic isolation; \n     and now is relying almost exclusively on ``engineered \n     barriers'' to keep radiological materials from migrating \n     out of the repository and into the environment, \n     essentially ignoring the foundational recommendation of \n     the National Academy of Sciences that manmade materials \n     not be used to compensate for faulty geology or hydrology; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Nuclear Energy Institute has declared that the \n     repository can be licensed ``without the mountain,'' yet, if \n     that is true, if the mountain is irrelevant and waste \n     packages can be made to last for 10,000 years, why make tens \n     of thousands of shipments of radioactive waste through the \n     nation's cities to a site as seismically adverse as Yucca \n     Mountain; and\n       Whereas, In July 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \n     D.C. Circuit threw out a radiation safety standard set by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency, finding that the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission ``breached its duty'' to protect the \n     health and safety of the public by limiting repository \n     performance standards to 10,000 years, essentially ignoring \n     the National Academy of Sciences when it recommended that the \n     standard exceed 300,000 years; and\n       Whereas, The recent court decision has not only delayed the \n     licensing process, but the Department of Energy has stated \n     that they are unable to meet a standard longer than 10,000 \n     years; and\n\n\n       Whereas, The Department of Energy contends it is better to \n     have all nuclear waste at a single location rather than \n     scattered around the country, yet this contention is flawed \n     because Yucca Mountain will be at capacity by the time it is \n     finally deemed to be ready for use, effectively putting to \n     rest the ``one safe site'' idea; and\n       Whereas, Those within the nuclear industry itself have \n     commented that storing high-level waste at a centralized \n     location is no longer essential and, in fact, permits have \n     been filed to build new nuclear power plants with on-site \n     storage and to increase storage at existing plants, the sites \n     of which are already protected by comprehensive security \n     plans; and\n       Whereas, The Department of Energy's own analysis of Yucca \n     Mountain suggests there would be fewer deaths and injuries if \n     the Department allowed the waste to continue to be stored at \n     existing power plants and storage sites until a safe and \n     permanent site and transportation proposal can be confirmed; \n     and\n       Whereas, Ninety percent of the waste to be shipped to Yucca \n     Mountain is now located east of the Mississippi and, if \n     transported, will impact at least 44 states, hundreds of \n     cities, thousands of communities and nearly 50 million \n     Americans who reside within 3 miles of potential shipping \n     routes; and\n       Whereas, An area identified as the Caliente rail corridor \n     has been designated as part of the transportation route, the \n     designation of which is being contested, particularly since \n     flooding occurred in that area in January 2005, eroding \n     approach embankments and causing railroad tracks to be washed \n     away, which led 5 to 10 trains to be rerouted through Reno; \n     and\n       Whereas, Compounding the transportation issue is the fact \n     that, even without an accident, Nevada's economy stands to \n     lose upwards of $5.5 billion annually as a result of the \n     stigmatizing effects of the repository and the transportation \n     of nuclear waste through the State; and\n       Whereas, As early as 1986, the Department of Energy \n     acknowledged the potential for impacts to a tourism-dependent \n     economy, an issue of great concern in Nevada, stating ``the \n     potential for adverse public perception of a repository and \n     its associated waste transportation could adversely affect \n     the tourism industry''; and\n       Whereas, Given the unique reliance of Nevada's economy on \n     the State's ability to attract tourists, any impacts that \n     reduce the number of visitors, especially to Las Vegas, would \n     have major economic consequences for this State, leading to \n     direct fiscal consequences for local governments as it is \n     predicted that, even without an accident, visitor spending \n     will decline by 7 percent, reducing local government tax \n     revenues by $91 million annually; and\n       Whereas, Not only is Nevada itself ranked the fastest \n     growing state in the nation but the Las Vegas Valley, in \n     particular, is one of the fastest growing areas in the \n     nation, with Henderson, North Las Vegas and Las Vegas being \n     among the top six fastest growing cities in the country, \n     which further raises concerns because Yucca Mountain is \n     located just 90 miles northwest of the Valley; and\n       Whereas, Recent setbacks include decreased funding by \n     Congress, delays in the licensing process and the backlog in \n     review by the Department of Energy of the documents to be \n     submitted with the application, of which there are more than \n     2 million documents still in need of study; and\n       Whereas, The inescapable conclusion is that the Federal \n     Government is in no way prepared to deal with, or is even \n     aware of, the effects of the Yucca Mountain project on \n     society and this country: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That numerous hurdles, including budget shortfalls, \n     an unresolved radiation health safety standard, and \n     transportation and corrosion issues, are cause for \n     reconsidering Yucca Mountain as the proposed site for a \n     nuclear waste repository; and be it further\n       Resolved, That President Bush is implored to remember a \n     pledge he made in Las Vegas on August 12, 2004, to ``stand by \n     the decision of the courts and the Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission,'' and to live up to this promise by ordering \n     the Department of Energy to stop its work on a license for \n     a nuclear waste repository in Nevada; and be it further\n       Resolved, That despite the fact that voters in Nevada chose \n     to re-elect President Bush, a recent poll indicates that \n     approximately 70 percent of Nevadans remain opposed to Yucca \n     Mountain, an ill advised project based on bad science, bad \n     law and bad public policy, a choice that ignores better, less \n     expensive and safer alternatives, a choice which hinders, not \n     helps, national security; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Nevada has already borne more than its fair \n     share of this nation's radioactive waste burdens, including, \n     hosting hundreds of nuclear weapons tests during the Cold War \n     and hosting the world's largest low-level and mixed \n     radioactive waste disposal facility at the Nevada Test Site, \n     which is also controlled by the Department of Energy; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the issue of how to dispose of nuclear \n     waste, the deadliest substance known to mankind, is of great \n     importance, requiring decisions to be based on ``sound \n     science,'' as was promised Nevada and the nation in 2000, \n     before it is put on the roads, railways and waterways of this \n     country; and be it further\n       Resolved, That with the abundance of safe, economical dry \n     storage facilities at existing reactor sites, there is no \n     current spent fuel emergency and nuclear power plants face no \n     risk of shutdown, the residents and political leaders of the \n     State of Nevada urge President Bush and Congress and all \n     involved agencies to recognize the unsuitability of Yucca \n     Mountain as the site for a repository to store and dispose of \n     spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, the Vice President of the United States as the \n     presiding officer of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, the Secretary of Energy and each member of \n     the Nevada Congressional Delegation;

and\n       Whereas, given the continuing widespread reliance of many \n     governments on nuclear energy and nuclear weapons, and given \n     the imminent threat of acts of terror at nuclear facilities \n     that could release large volumes of radiation into the global \n     environment, it is essential that the federal government \n     gather comprehensive data from a wide range of communities on \n     sustained and extensive exposure to low-level radiation; and\n       Whereas, the United States government carried out sixty-\n     seven above-ground tests of atomic and hydrogen bombs in the \n     region of Enewetak and Bikini in the Marshall Islands from \n     1946 through 1958; and\n       Whereas, these bomb tests affected not only the atolls of \n     Enewetak and Bikini, but also the downwind atolls of \n     Rongelap, Utrik, Ujae, and others; and\n       Whereas, these atomic blasts were thousands of times more \n     powerful than the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, \n     Japan; and\n       Whereas, three islands in the Bikini atoll and three \n     islands in the Enewetak atoll completely ceased to exist as a \n     result of these tests; and\n       Whereas, the federal government deliberately failed to \n     protect the citizens of the Republic of the Marshall Islands \n     from exposure to radioactive fallout; and\n       Whereas, significant numbers of residents of the four \n     affected atolls experienced acute radiation sickness, thyroid \n     cancer, skin cancer, other oncological illnesses, leukemia, \n     birth defects, stillbirths, damage to reproductive organs, \n     and endocrine disorders as a result of this exposure; and\n       Whereas, some of the radioactive materials released in \n     massive quantities in these atomic tests remain dangerously \n     radioactive for thousands of years; and\n       Whereas, the federal government has failed to conduct \n     comprehensive, independent, open, and transparent health \n     studies to determine the overall impact of the atomic bomb \n     tests on the health of the citizens of the Marshall Islands; \n     and\n       Whereas, newly declassified documents have verified that \n     the federal government carried out radiation experiments \n     deliberately injecting radioactive isotopes into Marshallese \n     citizens without their informed consent; and\n       Whereas, officials from the United States Department of \n     Energy, the National Cancer Institute, and other agencies \n     charged with the protection of public health have admitted \n     that they deliberately concealed or distorted the higher \n     thyroid cancer rates and other health effects among nuclear \n     survivors in the Marshall Islands; and\n       Whereas, the federal government has now threatened to cut \n     off funds for medical care and compensation of nuclear \n     victims in the Marshall Islands on the grounds that there is \n     no legal basis for such payments and that no further nuclear \n     health effects can be expected; and\n       Whereas, the Republic of the Marshall Islands currently \n     lacks the financial and technical resources needed to remedy \n     or combat the effects of radioactive fallout, to protect the \n     public from further radiation exposure, to complete the \n     further decontamination of all nuclear and military waste, or \n     the devolution and restoration of the affected lands; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2005, that the President of the United States and the \n     Congress of the United States are respectfully urged to seek \n     proper funding for medical care and compensation of nuclear \n     victims who are residents of the Republic of the Marshall \n     Islands, and for the development and decontamination of the \n     affected Marshall Islands communities; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the federal government is further requested \n     to immediately step up\n\n\n     their efforts to screen the health of exposed Marshall \n     Islands populations and in particular, all newborn infants, \n     now and in the future, that may suffer the long-term effects \n     of exposure to radioactive fallout caused by atomic and \n     hydrogen bomb testing conducted by the United States; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the federal government is urged to finance \n     and commission a comprehensive independent health study to \n     conclusively determine the impact of sustained exposure to \n     high-level and low-level radiation; provided that the scope \n     or duration of such health studies is requested to include \n     the likelihood of chromosome damage and the likely emergence \n     of genetic deformities in future generations; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the federal government is encouraged to \n     establish health centers in the Republic of the Marshall \n     Islands, and to finance and provide resources necessary to \n     sustain health care adequate to the needs of nuclear victims \n     that are Marshall Island residents; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Congress of the United States is \n     requested to hold public hearings on the Change of \n     Circumstances Petition both in Majuro, Republic of the \n     Marshall Islands, and in Washington D.C., and to allow \n     representatives of the non-governmental organizations from \n     Enewetak, Rongelap, Utrik, and Bikini to testify; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, through \n     the Secretary of State, the President of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the members of Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation, the Executive Director of the Aloha Medical \n     Mission, the President of Micronesians United, the Director \n     of Pacific Island and Asian American Ministry of the United \n     Church of Christ, the Director of ERUB (Enewetak, Rongelap, \n     Utrick, Bikini) Honolulu Marshallese Ministry, and the \n     Director of the Friends Retreat Center.", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n\n       POM-154.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada relative to mandating the reporting of \n     results of all clinical trials and the collection and \n     analysis of the data by the appropriate Federal agencies; to \n     the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                      Assembly Joint Resolution 14\n\n       Whereas, A clinical trial is a research study involving the \n     participation and observation of human volunteers to \n     determine the safety and effectiveness of drugs, biological \n     products or medical devices; and\n       Whereas, There is no comprehensive system for tracking, \n     organizing and disseminating information about ongoing \n     clinical trials, and it is estimated that only half of the \n     approximately 1 million trials conducted over the past 56 \n     years have been reported; and\n       Whereas, One consequence of this lack of reporting is \n     ``publication bias'' wherein positive results of trials are \n     reported in order to get a drug approved, while trials which \n     show harmful effects are not reported, resulting in a \n     distortion of evidence on which to base medical \n     determinations, allowing physicians to unwittingly prescribe \n     drugs that may have hazardous side effects; and\n       Whereas, There are many reasons that volunteers participate \n     in trials, such as gaining access to new treatments before \n     they are widely available, obtaining expert medical care at \n     leading health care facilities, playing an active role in \n     their own health care and helping others by contributing to \n     medical research; and\n       Whereas, There are many risks to participation in these \n     trials, including possible unpleasant and even life-\n     threatening side effects, and with a voluntary registry such \n     as suggested by the pharmaceutical industry, companies may \n     not report results that are unfavorable to their products, \n     betraying the volunteers' trust, and without this \n     information, there cannot be a true scientific evaluation of \n     the study of that drug; and\n       Whereas, Many trials that are performed by academic \n     researchers are sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, \n     presenting a conflict of interest when reporting the results \n     of the trials, and nearly one-fifth of government scientists \n     say they have been pressured to support approval of a drug \n     despite having concerns about its safety; and\n       Whereas, Each clinical trial in the United States must be \n     approved and monitored by an institutional review board, \n     which is an independent committee of physicians, \n     statisticians, community advocates and others, to ensure that \n     the trial is ethical and that the rights of the volunteers \n     are protected; and\n       Whereas, Prescription drugs are regulated by the Food and \n     Drug Administration, but with the discovery that some of the \n     drugs developed for arthritis have been found to increase the \n     risk of heart attacks and that some patients, especially \n     children and teenagers who were prescribed antidepressants \n     had increased rates of suicide and violence, with substantial \n     evidence of the suppression of negative data concerning these \n     drugs in clinical trials, there is a growing movement \n     supporting a national registry of all clinical trials; and\n       Whereas, The pharmaceutical industry opposes full \n     disclosure because of concerns that competitors would learn \n     their research and development secrets and it would affect \n     their profits, but the pharmaceutical industry is \n     consistently one of the most profitable industries in the \n     Fortune 500 list, and the welfare of the public must take \n     precedence over all else; and\n       Whereas, For these reasons, the American Medical \n     Association has called for all clinical trials to be \n     registered with the Federal Government; and\n       Whereas, The International Committee of Medical Journal \n     Editors has issued a statement that, as of July 1, 2005, they \n     will require registration in a public trials registry for all \n     clinical studies that involve human patients as a condition \n     of consideration for publication in member journals; and\n       Whereas, In the 108th Session of Congress, H.R. 5252 and S. \n     2933 were introduced which required researchers to enter \n     their clinical trials into a federal registry before starting \n     them and to report the results of the trials at the \n     conclusion, but these bills died in committee; and\n       Whereas, Under current law, pharmaceutical companies are \n     required to post information only about trials of drugs for \n     serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions which are \n     then posted on an existing government website, \n     www.ClinicalTrials.gov. that currently has a database of such \n     studies conducted in all 50 states and in over 100 countries; \n     and\n       Whereas, This website could be expanded to include \n     information about the purpose, duration and outcomes of all \n     clinical trials; and\n       Whereas, It is imperative that federal legislation be \n     introduced to create a centralized and comprehensive national \n     registry for mandatory reporting of all publicly and \n     privately funded clinical trials involving drugs, biological \n     products or medical devices; and\n       Whereas, Since it has been shown that unfavorable trial \n     results which placed financial interests at risk are \n     particularly likely to remain unpublished and hidden from \n     public view, any legislation must require that the results of \n     all clinical trials be reported, whether those results are \n     positive or negative, because selective reporting of results \n     distorts the body of evidence available for decision making; \n     and\n       Whereas, By creating a single, comprehensive database of \n     clinical studies and their results. scientific information is \n     easily available, in a timely fashion, for use by \n     researchers, journalists, public interest organizations, \n     health care providers, patients seeking to enroll as subjects \n     in clinical trials and the general public so that they may \n     make informed decisions, resulting in safer and more \n     responsible clinical trials; and\n       Whereas, Since many adverse effects do not surface until a \n     drug is taken over a long period of time, periodic updates \n     must be included in the registry to improve knowledge of the \n     risks of longterm use; and\n       Whereas, To be effective, legislation would need to require \n     that institutional review boards deny a stamp of approval to \n     a clinical trial unless it is registered in the database; and\n       Whereas, To regain the public's trust in the clinical \n     trials procedure, there must be full disclosure of the \n     results of all clinical trials, allowing physicians and \n     patients to make safe, appropriate and effective health care \n     decisions by having all relevant information available;

Bush; and\n       Whereas, all states that accept federal Title I education \n     funds, including Hawaii, are subject to the requirements of \n     the Act; and\n       Whereas, the purpose of the Act is to compel all public \n     schools to make adequate yearly progress toward the goal of \n     100 percent student proficiency in math and reading by 2013-\n     2014; and\n       Whereas, these expectations are unreasonable for students \n     with limited English proficiency and students with \n     disabilities, making it impossible for many of Hawaii's \n     schools, that have a high population of these students, to \n     comply with the law; and\n       Whereas, the Act does not allow states that may already \n     have successful accountability systems in place to use their \n     system to comply with the spirit of the Act; and\n       Whereas, states should be allowed to use a value-added or \n     student growth approach in their state accountability plan; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Act is an under-funded mandate that causes \n     states and school districts to spend more money than the \n     amounts appropriated by Congress to implement the Act; and\n       Whereas, the Act coerces participation by placing punitive \n     financial consequences on states that refuse to participate; \n     and\n       Whereas, in 2004, the National Conference of State \n     Legislatures created a bipartisan task force to study the \n     Act, resulting in suggestions for specific changes to make \n     the Act more workable, more responsive to variations among \n     the states, and more effective in improving elementary \n     education; and\n       Whereas, the recommendations of the task force's February \n     2005 Final Report include the following:\n       (1) Substantially increasing federal funding for the Act;\n       (2) Reexamining the financial consequences for states that \n     choose not to participate;\n       (3) Reevaluating the 100 percent proficiency goal \n     established by the Act;\n       (4) Conducting a Government Accountability Office study of \n     the compliance and proficiency costs associated with the Act;\n       (5) Giving the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n     primacy over the Act in cases where these laws may conflict; \n     and\n       (6) Providing states with much greater flexibility to meet \n     the objectives of the adequate yearly progress provisions of \n     the Act; and\n       Whereas, although the Act aims to provide flexibility for \n     states to improve academic achievement and to close the \n     achievement gap, the task force found that little flexibility \n     has been granted to states to implement the Act: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, By the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2005, the Senate concurring, that the United States Congress \n     is respectfully requested to amend the No Child Left Behind \n     Act of 2001 according to the recommendations of the February \n     2005 Final Report of the National Conference of State \n     Legislatures' Task Force on No Child Left Behind;

and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That Congress is requested to allow states more \n     flexibility to continue to work toward the goal of closing \n     the achievement gap without the threat of losing federal \n     funds; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Congress is requested to appropriate federal \n     funding in amounts consistent with the levels authorized in \n     the Act for education programs and expanded information \n     systems needed to accurately reflect student, school, and \n     school district performance and to pay the costs of ensuring \n     student proficiency; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Congress is requested to authorize \n     appropriate assessment methods and an alternative methodology \n     for determining adequate yearly progress targets and progress \n     for students who are not yet proficient in English and who \n     have certain disabilities;

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to the creation of a national cord blood stem cell \n     bank; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n\n                          House Resolution 75\n\n       Whereas, In discussion on stem cells in this country, one \n     available resource has too often been overlooked--stem cells \n     from umbilical cords. For example, a special type of stem \n     cells known as hematopoietic progenitor cells have been \n     successfully used for decades to reconstitute bone marrow and \n     circulating blood cells in patients whose bone marrow\n\n\n     has been damaged by chemotherapy or other underlying disease. \n     Blood collected from the umbilical cords of recently \n     delivered infants have proven advantages over other sources \n     of these cells, such as adult donors. Stem cells found in the \n     umbilical cord are less immunologically mature than other \n     sources, which lessens the risk of rejection when \n     transplanted. In addition, the collection of these cells \n     poses minimal risk to the mother and infant. In some cases \n     there are sufficient stem cells in one umbilical cord for a \n     transplant to reconstitute bone marrow in a recipient; and\n       Whereas, Nearly 12,000 Americans a year search for a bone \n     marrow donor. Of these, only a small fraction identifies a \n     relative who is an acceptable match for a successful \n     donation. All the others must rely on a transplant from a \n     stranger. More than 9 million adults have voluntarily entered \n     bone marrow donor registries worldwide. This number is not \n     sufficient to find a match for everyone in need; and\n       Whereas, The current system for collecting and registering \n     umbilical cord blood in the United States is fragmented, with \n     at least 20 public banks operating across the country, one of \n     which is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In 2004, the \n     United States Congress appropriated $10 million to the \n     Department of Health and Human Services' Health Resources and \n     Services Administration to establish a National Cord Blood \n     Stem Cell Bank Program. Congress directed the Institute of \n     Medicine to make recommendations to set up and operate the \n     bank. In April 2005 the Institute of Medicine met its \n     responsibility by issuing an extensive report with \n     recommendations on how to make the current system work and \n     expand it for the benefit of physicians and patients \n     searching for matching donors: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, By the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States and the \n     Department of Health and Human Services to take the steps \n     necessary to create the national cord blood stem cell bank \n     based on the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, the Secretary of the \n     Department of Health and Human Services and the Administrator \n     of the Health Resources and Services Administration.
