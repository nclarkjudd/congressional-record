Under the leadership of \nChairman Warner and Senator Levin, the ranking member, who have \ncontinued their tradition of strong and bipartisan leadership, the \nSenate Armed Services Committee was able to produce a very workable \npiece of bipartisan legislation. I would also like to thank my friend, \ncolleague, and subcommittee chairman, Senator Ensign, for his \ncooperation and leadership throughout the process this year.\n  I think the bill before us goes a long way to supporting the needs of \nour service men and women. In addition to highlighting some positive \nareas the committee focused on, I do want to highlight a few concerns.\n  First, I am pleased that an additional $50 billion has been \nauthorized for ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for \nthe first few months of fiscal year 2006. I am disappointed that the \nadministration's request did not include any funding to support our \ntroops in their ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for 2006, \nand that they have not yet done enough to provide the needed \naccountability for how funds in Iraq and Afghanistan have been used so \nfar. I think Congress has done the right thing by taking the initiative \nto provide funding now for these ongoing operations, rather than\n\n\nmaking the Army and the other services absorb these enormous expenses \nuntil next spring. It is imperative that we include an authorization of \nadditional funding in this bill.\n  But in the long term, we cannot continue to rely on supplemental \nfunding. The President should start submitting budgets that recognize \nthese enormous costs. The continued use of emergency authorizations to \nfund the global war on terrorism, and the administration's continued \nfailure to include the true cost of the war in the annual authorization \nrequest are bad for our military and are bad fiscal policy. For this \nreason, in the fiscal year 2005 emergency supplemental, we requested \nthat the Secretary of Defense provide a report to the Speaker of the \nHouse of Representatives, the majority leader of the Senate, and the \ncongressional Defense Committees that identifies such things as \nsecurity, economic, and Iraqi security force training performance \nstandards and goals. The report must also include an assessment of US. \nmilitary requirements, including planned force rotations, through the \nend of calendar year 2006. Once the process needed to identify these \nrequirements has been established, it should be possible for the \nDepartment of Defense to be able to identify funds needed for the \nglobal war on terrorism, and these costs should be able to be included \nin the fiscal year 2007 President's budget in February.\n  On the positive side, I am extremely pleased with the provisions \nsupporting the compensation and quality of life for the men and women \nin uniform. The budget includes funding for child care of military \nfamilies and for increased death gratuity to service members' survivors \nas well as increased service members' group life insurance.\n  But these increases do not go far enough to improve the quality of \nlife for our members of the military. The budget request did not \ninclude funding for the Citizen-Soldier Support Program, which improves \nand augments family readiness programs for families of the Reserve and \nGuard. The committee recommends an increase in operations and \nmaintenance, O&M, funds to expand the services of this program. The \nbudget did not include funding for the Parents as Teachers Program. The \ncommittee believes this program can provide a valuable service to \nmilitary families by providing instructional assistance to parents of \npreschool children.\n  In the O&M accounts, the Readiness Subcommittee did our best to \nsupport the readiness of our forces. Part of ensuring readiness is \nfunding it. As then-Secretary of the Navy Gordon England wrote to our \ncommittee earlier this year:\n\n       Readiness is a direct function of Operation and Maintenance \n     dollars available. Under-funding O&M adversely affects \n     readiness.\n\n  I am encouraged by the support for O&M funding in this bill, because \nthat translates directly into support for our men and women in uniform. \nThe subcommittee also took actions designed to improve the Army's \ntraining and get them to produce a strategy for both training and for \nthe basing of their forces as they convert to a modular brigade format.\n  I am pleased about our continued support for military construction \nand family housing needs that are so critical to quality of life for \nour service men and women. I also support many of the provisions we \nhave included that will further improve the management of the \nDepartment. I particularly appreciate the bipartisan effort that the \ncommittee made to address a wide range of procurement issues, \nenvironmental issues, and some longstanding DOD financial management \nproblems.\n  I share with the committee a great concern over the impact of the \nglobal war on terrorism on recruitment and retention. In order to \naddress this impact, the committee has recommended the payment of an \nincentive bonus not to exceed $2,500 to military members of the Active \nand Reserve components who transfer from the Regular or Reserve \ncomponent of one service to the Regular or Reserve component of another \nservice. The committee also recommends increasing the amount of \nselective reenlistment bonus for certain enlisted personnel and a \nretention incentive bonus for members of the selected Reserve qualified \nin a critical military skill or specialty.\n  With regard to the end strength of the services, the committee \nrecommends increases for the Army and the Marine Corps. As the conflict \ncontinues in Iraq, the Army and the Marine Corps are suffering the \ngreatest impact of prolonged tours of duty as well as multiple tours of \nduty. By increasing the end strength, the committee believes that the \nuse of the stop-loss practice will be significantly reduced. While we \nare already seeing a reduction in recruitment numbers, these increases \nare meant to alleviate some of the strain currently placed on the \nservice members deployed in the global war on terrorism.\n  Mr. President, this bill will provide needed funding for our service \nmen and women and the future of our national defense.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield back my time.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. AKAKA", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "S8587-S8588", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgS8587-4", "title": "NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT"}
