I commend my \ncolleagues on the Armed Services Committee. We have a magnificent \ncommittee. All members are very active. Our attendance is good and I am \nproud that this institution has such diligent and hard-working Senators \nto provide their input to our work on the Armed Services Committee.\n  I also recognize what I view, and this may be slightly biased on my \npart, as one of the finest professional staffs of any committee of the \nSenate. We have had a long history of extraordinary, competent, fair-\nminded, open-minded people who want to devote their careers to the men \nand women of the Armed Forces and the causes for which they offer their \nlife and limb, and that of their families.\n  Their work over the past several months has resulted in this \nimportant legislation. We completed the markup of this bill in record \ntime and in the spirit of true bipartisanship. In particular, I am \nprivileged to have the senior Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, a \nlongtime, dear, and valued friend, as my ranking member and full equal \nworking partner on this committee.

Mr. President, I have the floor.\n  We have served together on this committee for 27 years and we have, \nonce again, with the other wonderful collection of Senators on this \ncommittee and the staff, produced a bill which clearly supports our men \nand women in uniform and their families, and strengthens the national \nsecurity of our Nation.\n  I also want to acknowledge the strong support that we have received \nfrom the Republican leader and the Democratic leader of the Senate. \nThese two individuals have teamed up in years past to assist the \nmanagers in getting this bill through the Senate. I cannot ever recall \nstronger leadership by the Senate leaders. Maybe when our distinguished \ncolleague from West Virginia was the leader of the Senate at the time, \nI know he supported getting this bill through. His membership on this \ncommittee for these many years has been of great help to all of us who \nhave been privileged to serve as chairman and ranking member.\n  The bill before the Senate was unanimously reported out of the \ncommittee on May 12. It reflects the strong support for the members of \nour Armed Forces. The bill provides $441.6 billion in budget authority \nfor defense programs for the fiscal year 2006, an increase of $21 \nbillion, or 3.1 percent in real terms, above the amount authorized by \nthe Congress for fiscal year 2005.\n  At this juncture, I recognize the important contribution given by \nSenators Stevens and Inouye, the chair and ranking member, \nrespectively, of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. It \nhas been their hope that the Senate will act on this bill. Until such \ntime as the Senate does act, it is not likely that they will proceed \nwith the continuation of their deliberations, markup, and the like to \nbring their important bill to the floor. I say that because I want all \nSenators to recognize it is the intention of the Senate leadership and \nthe managers of this bill, together with our two colleagues on the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Defense, that this bill be acted upon by \nthe Senate prior to the scheduled recess for the month of August.\n  I mention that because one Senator had very politely said to me: I \nwould like to offer an amendment, but I think I will wait until after \nthe August recess. I politely informed him that it is the intention of \nall parties that this bill be enacted prior to the August recess. He \nappreciated my candor.\n  This amount is consistent with the President's budget request and \nwithin the budget resolution adopted by the Congress. The bill also \nincludes authorization for $50 billion in emergency supplemental \nfunding for fiscal year 2006 to cover the cost of military operations \nin Iraq, Afghanistan, and throughout the world, together with our \ncoalition partners, on the global war against terrorism.\n  I also acknowledge that while we put proper emphasis on Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and the war on terrorism, there are innumerable other \nmissions undertaken night and day by the men and women of the Armed \nForces for all aspects of the diverse security needs and requirements \nof this Nation. Many of them are on the far-flung outposts of the world \nperforming those missions beneath the sea, above the sea, or in the \nair. We acknowledge with fervent gratitude their contribution, together \nwith all of us who proudly served in uniform, and their families.\n  The past 3\\1/2\\ years have been a time of great successes and \nenormous challenges for the U.S. Armed Forces. The mission of our men \nand women in uniform has never been executed with better skill and \ndedication. I myself am privileged to have had modest experience in \nuniform. I have had the privilege of having an association with the men \nand women in uniform for 60 years. That is a long period of time. \nAlmost without exception, in all those years at some point in time I \nhave had the opportunity to either serve alongside of, or be in support \nof, the men and women of our Armed Forces. I had a very brief career in \nWorld War II, inauspicious as it was, and I had the opportunity to \nserve in that historic period. I would say unequivocally that, while \nour generation of World War II was referred to as ``the greatest,'' \nthis generation is every bit as great if not greater in the complexity \nof the threats posed against this Nation night and day and the \nsacrifices they are\n\n\nbeing called upon to make in the performance of their duties and those \nof their families.\n  The rapid success, and it was a rapid success, of Operation Enduring \nFreedom in Afghanistan and the rather prolonged but nevertheless \nsuccessful operation to date, Operation Iraqi Freedom, has evolved into \nthe hard work of reconstruction and stability operations in both \ntheaters, necessary to secure peace and stability in their respective \nregions. Such important work brings with it new challenges associated \nwith an extraordinarily high operational tempo on people and equipment \nand the need to counter asymmetric threats, including improvised \nexplosive devices and the ever increasing, tragic, tragic use of the \nsuicide bomber. Further, the responsibility of the Nation is to \nproperly care for those who volunteer to serve--active, National Guard, \nreserve, retired, and their families. They deserve nothing less than \nour total support. The bill, in my judgment, meets those challenges.\n  This bill is being considered at a time when the United States \ncontinues to work with a coalition to defeat terrorism globally and \ndefend freedom and democracy. The recent tragic aftermath of terrorist \nbombings in London reminds us once again, in this global war on \nterrorism, of the ruthless nature of the enemy we face. When I say \n``we,'' it is not only the United States, but freedom-loving people \nwherever they are in the world. It is a war we must and will win.\n  Hundreds of thousands of soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and \nCoast Guardsmen--active, reserve, and National Guard--and countless \ncivilians who support military, diplomatic, and humanitarian operations \nare serving valiantly in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other locations to \nsecure the hard-won military successes and to preserve peace and \nfreedom. Successful elections in Iraq and Afghanistan in the past year \nare testament to the yearning of those people for a voice in their own \ndestiny, the willingness of the United States to assist, and the \nprofessionalism of the brave Americans and their coalition partners who \nvolunteer to serve. The U.S. Armed Forces serving around the world are \ntruly the first line of defense in the security of our U.S. homeland.\n  We are all mindful of the risks members of the Armed Forces face \nevery day, and of the sacrifices made by the families and their \ncommunities. I repeat, the communities are so involved with the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces stationed overseas, the men and women in \nuniform who have been asked to do much in the past year and who \nresponded in the finest traditions of the generations of Americans who \npreceded them. The American people are proud of their men and women in \nuniform, and what they have accomplished to protect our freedom here at \nhome and abroad.\n  While recent successes have proven the value of past investment in \nthe people and equipment of the U.S. Armed Forces, this is no time for \nany complacency. The recurring lessons of our military operations are \nthat national security threats are ever changing and persistent. \nVictory and successes must be accomplished by vigilance and \npreparation. Such vigilance takes the form of enhanced readiness for \ntoday's Armed Forces, and preparation for future threats to the \nsecurity of the United States, its interests, and its allies.\n  In preparing this legislation, together with the members of our \ncommittee, we identified seven priorities to guide our committee's work \non the national defense bill now before the Senate. The first priority \nis to provide our men and women in uniform the resources they need to \nwin the global war on terrorism; second, to enhance the ability of the \nDepartment of Defense to fulfill its homeland defense responsibilities; \nthird, to provide the resources and authorities needed to rapidly \nacquire the full range of force protection capabilities for deployed \nforces, particularly with regard to improvised explosive devices; \nfourth, to continue the committee's commitment to improve the quality \nof life for those who serve--active, reserve, National Guard, and \nretired, and their families, with particular emphasis on recruiting and \nretention and on the health care for those who bear the wounds of our \nwar; fifth, to sustain the readiness of our Armed Forces to conduct \nmilitary operations against all current and anticipated threats; sixth, \nto support the Department's efforts to develop the innovative, forward-\nlooking capabilities necessary to modernize and transform the Armed \nForces; and, finally, to continue active committee oversight of \nDepartment programs and operations, particularly in the areas of \nacquisition reform to ensure proper stewardship of taxpayer dollars.\n\n  With passage of the bill before us, the Senate has the opportunity to \nsend a strong message in support of the men and women of the Armed \nForces serving at numerous posts at home and abroad that America values \nand honors their service and that of their families.\n  The bill contains much-deserved pay raises and benefits for military \npersonnel and their families, enhanced survivor benefits for those \nwhose loved ones have made the ultimate sacrifice, improved health care \nfor both active and reserve components of personnel and their families, \nand prudent investments in the equipment and technology our military \nneeds to address current and future threats.\n  I urge my colleagues to debate this bill in a constructive spirit and \nto support its adoption.\n  There is one issue I would like to highlight: My colleagues and I on \nthe committee, and I think almost every member of the committee shares \nthis view, and many of us in the Senate--we are all concerned about the \ndeclining state of the building of new ships for the U.S. Navy. We do \nnot believe the current or projected level of funding for shipbuilding \nis adequate to build the numbers of ships our Navy needs to perform and \ncontinue to perform its global missions. Always remember, the \nConstitution of the United States directs this Congress to raise its \narmies, but ``maintain'' a Navy. The Founding Fathers were specific in \nthat direction to the Congress and it is our duty to fulfill it. They \nhad the foresight to realize that a navy can not be quickly constituted \nor reconstituted. It takes a decade or more from the concept of a new \nship through the years to prepare the plans, to test the ship, to test \nthe system, and to finally slip it down the ways of the shipyard, and \nthen for a period of time to further test it before it gains its \nability to join the fleet. That is a long time.\n  In many respects that was as true years ago as it is today, so we \nmust learn the lesson that it takes time to maintain our Navy. As a \nmaritime nation, that presence of our Navy is often displayed in the \nform, not only of our ships, not only through ensuring open sealanes of \ncommunication and training in international waters, but also the \ninherent diplomatic mission of visiting our ports and proudly showing \nOld Glory, our flag. The Navy currently has 288 ships in the active \nfleet. This is the smallest number of ships in the Navy since before--I \nwould like to repeat this--the smallest fleet since before World War \nII. That is before December 7, 1941.\n  I believe the shipbuilding budget must be reviewed by the \nadministration as a matter of utmost urgency in the coming year, and I \nrespectfully urge the President to establish a special shipbuilding \nfund, to direct the OMB to provide a dedicated fund for the building of \nships rather than each year make the allocation--so much to the \nDepartment of the Navy, so much to the Department of the Air Force, so \nmuch to the Department of the Army. Keep those allocations as they are \ndevised each year, but superimpose on the allocation of funding for the \nNavy a sum of dollars to turn around this declining curve of \nshipbuilding.\n  America has much to be thankful for in terms of its patriotic young \nAmericans who volunteer to serve and who have individually and \ncollectively performed with such professionalism and distinction in \ndefense of the United States. The efforts of the U.S. Armed Forces have \nbeen remarkable, but they are not without cost--the loss of priceless \nlives that must be honored and remembered; the responsibility to care \nfor the survivors and their families; the cost of ongoing operations \nand related refurbishment or replacement of heavily used equipment; and \nthe responsibility to assure that those who serve, and their families, \nreceive the quality of life and the benefits they need and to which \nthey are entitled.\n  I believe the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2006 \nprudently addresses the defense needs of\n\n\nour Nation and recognizes the service and sacrifice of our men and \nwomen in uniform and their families, provides the resources necessary \nto win the global war on terrorism, and makes the necessary investment \nto provide for the security of our Nation in the years to come.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in sending a strong message of \nbipartisan support for our troops at home, their families, and to the \nother nations in the world--America is committed to freedom.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 3, "speaker": "Mr. WARNER", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I join with the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Warner, in bringing S. 1042, the National \nDefense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2006, to the Senate floor. I \ndo so proudly. I am always proud to stand next to Senator Warner and \nwith Senator Warner and our staffs in bringing this bill forward. It \nhas been many years that we have done this together, and we always look \nforward to it because it is a time we, together with our staffs, can \nspend time trying to strengthen the security of this country in a \nbipartisan way.\n  This bill, to my memory, has always been a bipartisan bill. Our \nstaffs work together on a bipartisan basis. The way they have worked \ntogether should be a role model for how we in the Senate should be \nworking. I congratulate Senator Warner for his leadership of our \ncommittee. He sets the right pattern for all of us. Again, it is an \nhonor to be standing here with him.\n  The bill we bring before the Senate is the product of 3 days of \nmarkup. I do not believe we needed a single recorded vote. There may \nhave been some voice votes where there were some differences, but I \ndon't even remember that. I think we worked out all of our differences. \nWhere there were differences that remained, I think we actually were \nable to address them, if not resolve them, but without actually a \nrecorded vote, if my memory is correct. That is quite a tribute to the \nleadership of Senator Warner as well.\n  We have a common interest in providing the support the men and women \nin uniform need and deserve. We are unanimous on that, regardless of \nour positions--which differ. As Members of the Senate we don't all have \nthe same position on events in Iraq--how we got there and how we \nproceed from here. There is no unanimity on that issue. And on a number \nof other issues there is not unanimity. But where there is unanimity is \nthat once that decision is made democratically to send our men and \nwomen to war, in harm's way, we stand behind them. And on that there is \nno dissent regardless of the positions of different Senators on the \nunderlying issues. The men and women in uniform deserve our support. \nThey are entitled to the support. During the Vietnam era, we had times \nwhen men and women in uniform did not receive the support they \ndeserved. That has not been true since Vietnam. And finally, I think \nour people recognize that the men and women we put in harm's way, who \nare in the uniform of the United States, when the Commander in Chief, \nthe Congress make a decision that they go to war, they are entitled to \nthe full support of the people and of the Congress of the United \nStates.\n\n  We are proud of these troops. Senator Warner and I have done many \nthings together in the Senate, and one of them has been to travel to \nvisit our troops. We have seen some of the most amazing men and women \nthis country can produce who are in uniform, some of the most \nprofessional, dedicated, committed, patriotic people you will ever find \nrepresenting the United States in uniform. We have been to far-flung \nplaces of the world. We have traveled long distances, but whenever we \narrived where we were going, we have had that kind of feeling that \nwhatever the thousands of miles were that we traveled to get there, it \nwas worth it just to be inspired literally by the men and women who \nrepresent this country and take the risks for all of us.\n  The bill that is reported by the Armed Services Committee will \nimprove the quality of life of the men and women in uniform, provide \nfunding needed to continue ongoing military operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, make needed improvements to the management of the \nDepartment of Defense, and authorize critical investments that are \nneeded to reduce the risks the United States will face in the 21st \ncentury.\n  First and foremost, the bill before us continues the increases in \ncompensation, in the quality of life our service men and women and \ntheir families deserve as they face the hardships that are imposed by \ncontinuing military operations around the world. Those demands have \nincreased significantly over the years, and we have tried to respond to \nthose demands and to those increased hazards which the men and women \nface.\n  In particular, the bill would authorize a 3.1-percent across-the-\nboard pay raise for military personnel, authorize a $70 million \nincrease in childcare and family assistance, services for military \nfamilies, and authorize additional funds for supplemental education aid \nto local school districts affected by the assignment or location of \nmilitary families.\n  We have increased the death gratuity to $100,000 for survivors and \nmilitary members who die in a combat zone, and we are going to have an \namendment which will broaden that further. We have increased from \n$250,000 to $400,000 the maximum amount of coverage available under the \nService Members Group Life Insurance Program.\n  Second, the bill would provide funding needed to continue ongoing \nmilitary operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and help address the \nchallenges our military faces around the world. For instance, the bill \nwould authorize a $50 billion supplemental to cover part of the cost of \nongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan over the coming \nyears. We know that supplemental is going to be needed. We on the Armed \nServices Committee asked the Budget Committee to add this money for our \nauthorization bill because we have to plan on this expenditure. We know \nit is going to take place, and we should authorize it as part of a \nregular budget process and not just simply leave it to supplemental \nfunding.\n  So we are authorizing a $50 billion supplemental for 2006 to cover \nongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is far more \nrealistic budgeting than we have too frequently not done in the past.\n  Our bill authorizes an increase in the Army's active-duty end \nstrength by 20,000 people to a total of 52,400 soldiers for fiscal year \n2006. It is going to be a challenge to meet that new end strength just \nin terms of recruitment, but we are determined that we are going to try \nto respond to the demand of our members of the military by increasing \nthe size of the Army's active-duty end strength. We have added 20,000 \nto that and added $1.4 billion over the President's request for force \nprotection gear for our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. We authorize \nalmost $350 million for up-armored vehicles to provide additional force \nprotection for our troops in the field. That represents an increase of \n$120 million over the President's budget request.\n  We direct that $500 million be dedicated to the joint improvised \nexplosive device, IED, task force to facilitate the rapid development \nof technology to counter the top threat to our men and women in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. The chairman of our committee described the threat in \nterms of those IEDs and what we are doing to respond to that threat, \nwhich is everything we possibly can do given its nature and the fact \nthat threat is really, if not the top threat, one of the top threats to \nour service personnel.\n  Our bill authorizes up to $500 million for the continuation of the \nCommanders Emergency Response Program. This program enables our \nmilitary commanders in the field to respond quickly and flexibly to \nurgent requirements in fiscal years 2006 and 2007. They have told us \nthat this authorization and appropriation which follows is one of the \nmost effective actions we can take to increase their capability in the \nfield, and that Commanders Emergency Response Program continued at $500 \nmillion for these 2 years is provided.\n  Third, the bill contains a number of important provisions to improve \nthe efficiency and the transparency of the Department's operations. For \ninstance, the bill contains provisions that would prohibit the \ninappropriate use of contracting techniques that result in the \nheightened risk of fraud and abuse by\n\n\nlimiting the Government's insight into contractor cost and performance \nin the acquisition of major weapons systems.\n  It addresses continuing awareness of interagency contracts by \nrequiring the inspector general to review major interagency contracts \nwhich have been used by the Department of Defense. There have been real \nabuses in these interagency contracts, and we have, indeed, had a \nnumber of hearings over the years into some of these abuses where one \nagency uses the contract of another agency in order to carry out some \nfunction, but there is no transparency. Nobody knows it is done. You \ncan do it noncompetitively. There is too much opaqueness in that \nprocess, and we are trying to make sure the abuses in the interagency \ncontract area are addressed, and so we require the inspector general to \nreview the major interagency contracts the Department of Defense is \nusing or has used.\n  Our bill strengthens the defense ethics oversight by requiring major \ndefense contractors to identify former Department of Defense officials \non their payrolls and by requiring a review of ethics rules that are \nraised by the increased use of contractors to perform Government \nacquisition functions, and we establish a contract fraud risk \nassessment team to assess the vulnerability of Department of Defense \ncontract fraud, waste, and abuse and require the Secretary of Defense \nto develop an action plan to address these areas of vulnerability.\n  Finally, the bill contains a number of critical provisions that \nshould help reduce some of the risks our country will face in the \ncoming century. We are particularly pleased that the bill authorizes \nthe budget request for the Department of Defense Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program and related Department of Energy nonproliferation \nprograms. The greatest probable threat we face as a nation would be if \na terrorist or terrorist group could get their hands on a nuclear \nweapon or weapon of mass destruction.\n  There are too many loose nukes in this world. We have to do more to \naddress the proliferation threat. I don't believe the funding in this \nbill is adequate. I hope we can find a way to increase the amount of \nfunding that goes into this threat reduction program and the other \nnonproliferation programs that are funded in this bill. Other than \ngiving all the support we possibly can to our troops, there is probably \nnothing in this bill that directly addresses the greatest threat we \nface, which is the threat of a nuclear weapon in the hands of a \nterrorist, than this threat reduction program and the nonproliferation \nprograms which are aimed at securing nuclear weapons and other weapons \nof mass destruction.\n  Our bill provides the President permanent authority to waive on an \nannual basis the condition that must be met before the Cooperative \nThreat Reduction Program money can be provided to countries of the \nformer Soviet Union. This is an authority which the administration has \nrequested. Instead of having to come to us each year for this \nauthority, we believe it should be made permanent. Our bill enhances \nthe authority of the Secretary of Defense to use cooperative threat \nreduction funds to address risks of proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction outside the countries of the former Soviet Union. We not \nonly have nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction inside those \ncountries, we have those risks outside, and we ought to use this \nprogram to address again what is surely the most, or one of the most, \nserious risks any nation can face.\n  We in our bill earmark $100 million of missile defense money \nspecifically for enhanced ground and flight testing to require \nobjective testing and evaluation of the operational suitability of each \nblock of missile defense that is produced.\n  There hasn't been enough testing in this program. There has been too \nmuch buying before we fly, and we are trying to see if we can't take \nsome of the risk out of this program, to see, if we are going to \nproceed, whether we can't proceed in a way which would guarantee a \nsystem which is effective and workable and useful rather than just \nplowing billions of dollars into a system procuring missiles that may \nnever be usable. So we take some of this money, specifically $100 \nmillion of that program, and we address it specifically to ground and \nflight testing in addition to what was previously planned.\n  We add $20 million to the President's budget to accelerate chemical \ndemilitarization activity and to enable the United States to meet \nobligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  While this bill takes many important steps to fund the national \ndefense and support our men and women in uniform, there is more that we \ncan and should do. I would like to just mention a few areas that I hope \nwe can revisit as our bill is considered in the Chamber.\n  First, the bill contains a provision that would increase the military \ndeath gratuity from $12,000 to $100,000, but it is restricted to \ncombat-related deaths. That means that the families of soldiers, \nsailors, airmen and marines who die in the line of duty outside of the \ncombat area will still receive only $12,000. Our top military officers \nhave uniformly testified that the amount of the death gratuity should \nnot be dependent on the circumstances of somebody who is on active \nduty. The death of a family member in an accident, for instance, while \non active duty can be every bit as hard on a family as a death in Iraq \nor Afghanistan. Somebody who is killed while being trained for duty in \nIraq or Afghanistan should surely have his or her family provided with \nthe same kind of benefit as somebody who is killed in combat. From the \nfamily perspective and I think morally, there is no significant \ndifference. They are on active duty, they are taking risks, and they \nare killed while taking those risks on active duty.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified before our \ncommittee the following:\n\n       When you join the military, you join the military. You go \n     where they send you. It's happenstance that you are in a \n     combat zone or at home. And I think we in the past held \n     treating people universally foremost and consistently and \n     that's how I come down on that.\n\n  So our top uniform folks support the uniform application of that \nbenefit to $100,000 for people who are on active duty.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate adopted that position. We adopted an \namendment to the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act which would \nhave made the families of all soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines \nwho die in the line of duty eligible for the full death benefit. The \nappropriations amendment was dropped in conference, but we should try \nagain. I hope the Senate will stand strong on this issue and adopt a \nsimilar amendment to our bill.\n  Second, while the bill takes many positive steps to improve \ncompensation and benefits for our men and women in uniform and their \nfamilies, we have to do more for Guard and Reserve forces who are \nbearing so much of the burden in our current military operations.\n  Never before have we relied so heavily on the Guard and Reserve to \nserve on active duty over such an extended period of time. All members, \nrepresenting different States, understand that. The families of the men \nand women who are in our Guard and Reserve forces have reminded us \nabout how overly stretched those forces are. We do not get many \ncomplaints from the men and women themselves. They are too professional \nto do the complaining. We hear from families. We hear from employers.\n  Again, we have never before relied as heavily on our Guard and \nReserve forces to serve on active duty for extended periods of times as \nwe do now. Studies have shown that 40 percent of our junior enlisted \nmembers in the Reserve components nonetheless have no health insurance \nexcept when they are on active duty. I hope we can develop an approach \nto this problem that uses the military's TRICARE health care program to \nensure that members of the Reserve component have adequate health \ninsurance and are medically ready when called upon to serve.\n  Third, the bill earmarks $100 million of missile defense money \nspecifically for enhanced ground and flight testing and requires \nobjective testing and evaluation of the operational capability of each \nblock of missile defense which is produced. Those are positive steps, \nas I have said, which will move us in the direction of the ``fly before \nyou buy'' approach that we insist on with other major acquisitions.\n  However, the bill also authorizes more than $60 million in long-lead\n\n\nfunding for more interceptors on top of the 30 we already are buying, \neven though those interceptors are not subject to operational testing \nand evaluation. If we want a missile defense that works, rather than \none that sits on the ground and soaks up money, we should insist on \ntesting the missiles that we already have before we go out and buy \nmore.\n  Finally, the administration requested $8.5 million for research and \ndevelopment of the robust nuclear earth penetrator, even though \nCongress canceled this program last year. Although the bill does cut \n$4.5 million of the Air Force money from this program, it authorizes \nthe Department of Energy to spend $4 million to resume the feasibility \nstudy. Instead of being a leader in the effort to prevent the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons, we, ourselves, pursue the development \nof a new nuclear weapon. It is exactly the wrong message to send to the \nrest of the world.\n  We are trying to persuade the rest of the world, don't go nuclear. We \nare telling some of those countries, if you do go nuclear, we may take \nvery serious action to prevent you from crossing certain red lines. Yet \nwe, ourselves, again are on the verge of putting in money to resume a \nfeasibility study for a new nuclear weapon to be developed. I know it \nis only a study, but it is a message. It is a loud message. It is a \ndramatic message. It is a compelling message. It is a persuasive \nmessage, and it is used against us when we go to other countries and \nsay: Don't go down that nuclear road.\n  They say: Wait a minute. You are considering the possibility of going \nfurther and you already have thousands of nuclears and you are trying \nto persuade us that we should not be using nuclear weapons to defend \nourselves when you are studying an additional use or additional weapon \nyourself? It weakens our argument and it weakens the argument that we \nmust make against the most serious threat we face, which is the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  Finally, as our chairman has said, as we begin consideration of this \nbill, the men and women of our Armed Forces, both Active and Reserve, \nare deployed in harm's way in many areas of the globe that are \nsubjected to daily armed attack in Iraq and Afghanistan. We joined \ntogether in standing behind our troops in expressing pride the \nextraordinary accomplishments on the battlefield. This bill will do \nmuch to provide them with the equipment they need and the compensation \nand benefits they deserve. If we can do more, we ought to do more. They \ndeserve it, and their families deserve it.\n  We have important issues to debate. Again, I conclude by thanking \nChairman Warner for his leadership, bringing this bill to the floor and \nhaving this bill in the fairly complete shape it is in coming to the \nSenate. I thank him for his leadership of our staffs. We have wonderful \nstaff, as he mentioned, and we have a wonderful committee.\n  We are blessed to have members on our committee who all contribute in \nsuch important ways to the production of the bill. One of those members \njust walked off the floor. I, as Senator Warner did, want to recognize \nSenator Byrd although he is not here. He is stalwart in his commitment \nto this Senate and to this Nation. There are times when his plate is so \noverly full and his heart is so heavy, but nonetheless he performs his \nduty, and he is an inspiration to all members. All members of our \ncommittee deserve praise for the contribution they made to the bill.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. LEVIN", "itemno": 6}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000154", "text": "  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, there has been tremendous effort of our \ncommittee on both sides of the aisle with respect to the equipment \nbeing used, primarily in Iraq at this time, but could well be used \nelsewhere. We refer to them as the up-armored high mobility \nmultipurpose wheeled vehicles; humvees are part of that. There is a \nrange of these vehicles.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to add $105 million to the Army and \n$340 million to the Marine Corps for emerging up-armored HMMWV \nrequirements that the United States Central Command, under General \nAbizaid, has established.\n\n\n  In the last few days, I was down at Quantico where they have a \nmagnificent research and development and forward-looking contingent. I \nlooked on the parade grounds at a series of vehicles being modified in \ncertain ways to provide a greater degree of protection to the \noccupants--namely, our soldiers or Marines--who must use these vehicles \nin the face of this insidious, frightful threat of suicide bombers, \nimplanted bombs which are activated by different devices, even a simple \ncell phone. This is tough going.\n  I commend a number of Senators--Senator Kennedy, Senator Bayh, a \nnumber of Senators on my side--who have been working this issue for \nsome years. The hour and the time has come to add significant sums of \nmoney.\n  At some point in this debate on the amendment I will go into further \ndetail, but the Committee on the Budget allocated to the Committee on \nArmed Services a very significant amount of money to be authorized at \nour discretion for the purposes of the immediate requirements of the \nmilitary in connection with their missions today, primarily in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  The Army's current global war on terror requirement for up-armored \nHMMWVs is 10,000 vehicles. The Marine Corps current global war on \nterrorism requirement for up-armored HMMWVs is approximately 500 \nvehicles.\n  The markup of the fiscal year 2006 Defense bill, the one we are on, \nrecommends that $120 million be provided to the Secretary of the Army \nto address the emerging up-armored HMMWV requirements toward its \n10,000-unit requirement. The Secretary of the Army was provided the \nauthority and flexibility to procure up-armored HMMWV's tactical wheel \nadd-on armor, the M1151, the M1152 HMMWVs, once the Army received a \nvalidated requirement from a combatant commander. The amendment is \nfunded for 11,693 up-armored HMMWVs, and the Marine Corps is funded for \n498 up-armored HMMWVs through December 2005.\n  Since the markup of the fiscal year 2006 authorization bill, the \ncommittee has received new information that justifies, in our judgment, \nthe increase of the Army and the Marine Corps requirement for dollars \nto meet the up-armored HMMWV goals. The Army has an emerging \nrequirement for up-armored HMMWVs for Afghanistan which may increase \nthe overall requirement by 300 up-armored HMMWVs.\n  The Marines Expeditionary Force Forward Commander recently requested \nthat all HMMWVs in his area of operation be upgraded to the up-armored \nHMMWV variant. This could potentially increase the Marine Corps \nrequirement to 2,814 up-armored HMMWVs, of which 988 are now funded.\n  In keeping with the commitment of the Committee on Armed Services to \nmeet all force protection requirements, this amendment proposes to add \n$105 million to the Army budget authorized and $340 million to the \nMarines Corps to allow the Department to respond quickly to the \ncommander's request. It is there.\n  This is quite a complicated amendment. A number of Senators have \nexpressed an interest in this amendment. I would like to debate this \ntonight. I request the leadership consider having a record vote in due \ncourse. I urge Senators who have an interest in this matter to \ncommunicate with me or Senator Levin.\n  I would like to have Senators' views. I propose to put it to one \nside; thereby giving a full opportunity for all members to express \ntheir views. Again, I will seek the authority of the leadership to have \na record vote on this. Each Senator will want to vote on this \namendment. I cannot think of any equipment issue more important to the \nmen and women from your States than this.\n  I want to accommodate my colleagues, and I will yield the floor so my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Levin, can make such comments as he \nwishes.", "turn": 10, "speaker": "Mr. WARNER", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first, this amendment addresses a very \nsignificant issue, which took up a lot of time of the committee. We \nhave, in the bill itself, added some additional money to what the \nadministration requested because their request was so inadequate to the \nthreat. We have found over the period of time we have been in Iraq and \nAfghanistan a totally inadequate response to our armor needs.\n  We have had I don't know how many hearings in the Armed Services \nCommittee--the chairman says about five; and that would be about my \nrecollection, too--where we have pressed our military leaders, the \nSecretary of Defense, as to why there has been such a slow response to \nsuch an obvious need. So we have been pressing very hard to provide all \nof the adequate resources. We get different answers from the people who \nrun the Defense Department than we get from the people who are \nproviding the vehicles.\n  We were told, for instance, by the manufacturer that they never got a \nrequest for an increased amount. On the other hand, our military \nleaders said: Well, sure, we pressed for an increase in the amount.\n  We have a total conflict on the subject of whether there was ever a \ntime when funding was short, because the committee was determined that \nwe provide all of the resources--all of the resources--that are \nnecessary to provide the armor. It is inexcusable we have men and women \nwho are subject to these devices on the side of the road who do not \nhave the best armor.\n  Hearing after hearing, we put pressure on our civilian and uniformed \nleaders to provide the equipment our men and women deserve, and the \narmor our men and women deserve.\n  There has been a number of Members of our committee, particularly \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Bayh, and others, who have had not only a \nmajor interest in and made a major effort to press for additional \nfunding and for additional armor but who I know are interested in this \nsubject on this bill.\n  So I suggest to my friend from Virginia that we give them an \nopportunity to read what he has now offered because I think it would be \nvery possible they may want to either go in a slightly more increased \ndirection or in a different direction. And I am not sure, they may want \nto offer a second-degree amendment to this amendment or they may be \nperfectly happy to cosponsor it. But I would like to give them an \nopportunity, since this does come at this hour, to read to see exactly \nwhat is being proposed since they have such an interest in this issue \nand I know they were planning on offering language on this bill.\n  I would join in the suggestion that this language be available \npromptly to the members of the committee or any Member of the body \nbecause I think every Member of this body has had an interest in trying \nto press the Defense Department to provide greater armor at greater \nspeed.\n  I have been very dissatisfied, publicly, as to an issue having to do \nwith the fact that our military leaders tried to get the manufacturer, \nas we understand it, to have a second source. That would have required \nthe manufacturer to share some technology with the second producer. \nAccording to one story, they refused to share the technology with a \nsecond producer. If that is true, as I said publicly before, it would \nbe pretty shocking we would have a contractor who produces material for \nthe Defense Department, who knows we desperately need more, who would \nnot share the technology with a second source so we could produce the \narmor a lot faster.\n  There is a lot of significant background. I think we ought to give \nevery member of our committee and every Member of the Senate an \nopportunity to take a look at the approach the chairman is proposing to \nsee whether this meets the various needs and thoughts of Members of the \nSenate.

It is a particular thrill for me to have that \nhonor.\n  I am privileged to serve as the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nStrategic Forces. In that capacity, I have worked hard, our staff has \nworked hard, in cooperation particularly with my ranking member on the \nStrategic Forces Subcommittee, Senator Nelson of Florida. Our efforts \nhave been to contribute our part to the bill that is now before the \nSenate.\n  Under the leadership of Senator Warner, we believe we have achieved \nour goal of bringing forward legislation that serves the national \nsecurity needs of this country, protects the interests of our fighting \nmen and women, and does so while making deliberate and judicious use of \nprecious taxpayer dollars. We simply have to be frugal. There is no \nmoney to waste.\n  The Strategic Forces Subcommittee exercised oversight for the \nDepartment of Defense budget request for missile defense, strategic \nforces, space, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and \nintelligence support activities. The DOD budget request in these areas \nincluded $9.5 billion in procurement, $27.2 billion in research and \ndevelopment, and $3 billion in operations and maintenance. The \nadministration budget request also included $14.8 billion for the \nDepartment of Energy nuclear weapons and environmental management \nprograms and activities.\n  The bill reflects a net increase of $40 million in procurement, a net \ndecrease of $16 million in research and development, and a net increase \nof $11 million in the amount requested in operations and maintenance, \nfor a total net increase of $35 million--not a lot of increase. It also \nreflects the requested level of funding for the Department of Energy \nprograms and activities.\n  The bill fully funds the request for missile defense, but it does so \nin a way that reduces some funding for longer term developmental \nefforts to support near-term capabilities and enhanced testing. \nOverall, $8.8 billion was requested for missile defense activities, of \nwhich $7.8 billion is for the Missile Defense Agency.\n  Significant funding actions in the markup include an increase of $100 \nmillion for the ground-based midcourse defense system to enhance ground \nand flight testing, and an increase of $75 million for the Aegis BMD \nsystem to improve system performance and to accelerate SM-3 missile \ndelivery in 2007. Both of these systems, while continuing to undergo \ndevelopment and testing, are available today for use in an emergency to \nprotect the United States and its allies against limited ballistic \nmissile attacks. By focusing\n\n\non near-term capabilities, this bill sends a strong message to \npotential adversaries that the United States is no longer vulnerable to \nballistic missile threats or coercion.\n  The bill makes significant adjustments to the President's budget \nrequest for military satellite programs. The bill recommends a $200 \nmillion reduction in the Transformational Satellite Program, TSAT, to \nput the program on a healthier developmental track; an increase of $100 \nmillion for the Advanced Extremely High Frequency Satellite Program, \nAEHF, to begin procuring a fourth AEHF communications satellite; and a \nreduction, however, of $75 million for the Space Radar Program due to \ninsufficient programmatic and cost definition. We expect this Space \nRadar Program to be successful as time goes by.\n  Related to the Department of Energy, the bill includes $14.8 billion \nfor nuclear weapons and environmental management programs for the \nfiscal year 2006, the amount requested by the administration. Of this \namount, $6.6 billion is for the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration nuclear weapons activities.\n  The bill includes a few modest increases to help reduce deferred \nmaintenance and to support the infrastructure of the nuclear weapons \ncomplex. The bill also increases funding for security at Department of \nEnergy sites. This is a reflection of the need to enhance security at \nthese sites in response to the potential threats that exist after 9/11.\n  The bill also includes authorization at the budget request to \ncontinue the feasibility study of the robust nuclear earth penetrator, \nRNEP. This bill does not, however, provide any funding for Air Force \nactivities to integrate RNEP into a delivery platform. The committee \nhas honored the balance struck 2 years ago when Congress enacted a \nprovision prohibiting the administration from proceeding beyond a \nfeasibility study of RNEP without explicit authorization from Congress. \nNo such authorization was sought by the administration this year, and \nnone is provided. The $4.0 million provided for RNEP is for \ncontinuation of the feasibility study and nothing beyond that.\n  The bill also funds the Department of Energy Environmental Management \nProgram at $6.6 billion. The Environmental Management Program is \naddressing the environmental cleanup needs at Department of Energy \nnuclear sites. This environmental contamination is an unfortunate and \nhighly expensive legacy of our victory in the Cold War. Our bill \nprovides appropriate funding to continue this cleanup program.\n  Again, I thank the ranking member on the Strategic Forces \nSubcommittee, Senator Nelson, for working with me on this legislation \nand throughout our hearings and in the markup leading up to this point. \nThe Armed Services Committee takes a lot of time and deliberation to \nproduce this bill. It is the product of a lot of hard work, a lot of \nhard choices, and a fair amount of compromise. I hope my colleagues \nwill support the bill that our committee has produced. I again express \nmy appreciation to Chairman Warner for his leadership, for the fact \nthat we have been able to move this bill promptly this year. I think \nour Nation is going to benefit from many of the important provisions \nthat are contained in it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.", "turn": 29, "speaker": "Mr. SESSIONS", "itemno": 39}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak with respect to \namendment No. 1326. to the Defense authorization bill, which was \nadopted by the Senate today, that directly affects the citizens of \nPueblo, CO, and the cleanup of those chemical weapons stockpiled at the \nPueblo Chemical Depot. I thank my colleagues, Senator Warner and \nSenator Levin, and their staffs, for their help on this measure. I \nthank, too, Senators McConnell and Bunning and my colleague from the \ngreat State of Colorado, Senator Allard. We have maintained an \nimportant alliance on this issue, and I appreciate their efforts.\n  This bipartisan Pueblo amendment, which I am proud to cosponsor, \nmoves $51 million from the Department of Defense's Research, \nDevelopment, Test and Evaluation budget to the Military Construction \nbudget for the Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternatives program. This \nprogram, known as ACWA, is the authority for chemical weapons \ndestruction at both the Pueblo Chemical Depot and the Bluegrass, KY, \nsite.\n  More than three-quarters of a million chemical weapons--mustard agent \nrounds--are stockpiled in the Pueblo Chemical Depot. These weapons are \na threat to the security of the surrounding community. The United \nStates has sworn to safely destroy these weapons before the 2012 \ndeadline established by the Chemical Weapons Convention. Progress has \nbeen slow in the past but has recently been moving forward.\n  Unfortunately, under the President's budget request, there was no \nmoney allotted for Military Construction at the Pueblo Chemical Depot \nfacility for fiscal year 2006. The program was on hold at the time the \nbudget was released. But now that the dedication and hard\n\n\nwork of the citizens of Pueblo, along with a strong bipartisan effort \nhere in DC, has resulted in forward progress, money needs to be \ndesignated specifically for MilCon so the Department of Defense can \nspend money for ACWA construction projects. Without money being \ndesignated for MilCon, the progress at Pueblo Chemical Depot could be \nhalted once again.\n  The amendment adopted today was cosponsored by the Senators from \nColorado and Kentucky. It ensures that money will be available to be \nspent in fiscal year 2006 for construction, planning, and design work \nat both the Pueblo Chemical Depot in Colorado and at the Bluegrass, KY, \nsite.\n  This amendment is an essential step forward for the destruction of \nthe tons of chemical weapons still stored at the Pueblo Chemical Depot. \nI hope this is another indication that the Pentagon recognizes the \nurgency this situation demands--an urgency the people of Pueblo and all \nof Colorado are right to expect.\n  I am proud to be part of such a strong coalition of concerned \ncitizens and Senators from the communities impacted by these terrible \nweapons.
