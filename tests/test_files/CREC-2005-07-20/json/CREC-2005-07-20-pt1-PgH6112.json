Mr. Speaker, in spite of all of what the \npessimists have said, and regardless of what the mainstream media \nreports, the economy has greatly improved.\n  The facts are plain and simple. Our Nation is producing more, and our \ngovernment is spending less. The estimated Federal budget deficit is \n$94 billion less than the earlier prediction, and we have had 14 \nconsecutive quarters of economic growth.\n  House Republicans have faith in America's ability to grow our \neconomy, and we look to the future with confidence. Our job in Congress \nis to hold the line on spending. And the unemployment rate has fallen \nto 5 percent, the lowest since September 2001, with nearly 4 million \nnew jobs created in the last 2 years alone.\n  Sustained job growth, falling deficits, low interest rates and a \nbooming housing market: America's economy is robust and getting \nstronger.\n  With fiscal responsibility and passing pro-growth bills, including \nthe death tax repeal and legal reform, we continue to show our \ncommitment to growing America's economy. But there is still work to do. \nI am hopeful that Congress will approve the highway and energy bills \nwhich will add new jobs to the economy, help improve our roadways, and \ndecrease our dependence on foreign oil.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PRICE of Georgia", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": false, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "H6112", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "AMERICA'S WORKING", "id": "CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6112", "title": "AMERICA'S WORKING"}
