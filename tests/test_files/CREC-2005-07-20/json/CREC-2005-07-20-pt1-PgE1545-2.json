Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding \nNaval Officer, Rear Admiral Michael L. Holmes. Admiral Holmes is a \nmember of the Lumbee Indian Tribe and hails from Lumberton, North \nCarolina. After graduating from Pembroke State University in 1972, he \nwas commissioned as a Naval Officer and designated a Naval Aviator. \nAdmiral Holmes has served with distinction for nearly 32 years in the \nNavy, including several tours in command of operational forces and \nseveral important staff positions. Admiral Holmes is a person of \ntremendous talent, determined drive, and rich personality. His record \nof achievement is among the most remarkable on a long and distinguished \nlist of military officers hailing from the Tar Heel State. He displays \nleadership that inspires others to give their all and puts them at ease \nas they strive to excel. He embodies the core values of honor, courage, \nand commitment. This great North Carolinian continues to bring great \ncredit and honor to his native state, to his people, and to his family. \nAs a nation, we are indeed honored by his long, faithful, and \nproductive service to our country.\n  Admiral Holmes will retire from the United States Navy on October \n1st, 2005. Mr. Speaker, Mike Holmes and his wife, Vee, have made many \nsacrifices during his long and illustrious career, and I offer a \nprofound thanks to him from the citizens of North Carolina's Seventh \nCongressional District for his service. As they embark on the next \ngreat adventure beyond their beloved Navy, may God's strength, joy, and \npeace be with them both.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McINTYRE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1545", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "A TRIBUTE TO REAR ADMIRAL MICHAEL L.
