Mr. Speaker, I submit the following eulogies honoring, \nJ.J. Jake Pickle the Doggett Special Order.\n\n                           (By Peggy Pickle)\n\n       Austin, TX, June 22.--Good afternoon! Hot tamale!!! This is \n     not going to be a sad funeral. This is a celebration of a \n     remarkable life. I'm Jake and Beryl's daughter, Peggy. My \n     father asked me to speak on behalf of our family at his \n     memorial service.\n       Everyone in this sanctuary knows what kind of man Jake \n     Pickle was. Most of you are familiar with his life and \n     career: born in West Texas in 1913, attended the University \n     of Texas, served in the Navy during World War II, had a \n     lifetime love affair with politics which included 31 years \n     representing the 10th Congressional District of Texas in the \n     United States House of Representatives. He had two wives, \n     three children, six grandchildren, and four great-\n     grandchildren.\n       He was a tolerant and demanding man. Tolerant because he \n     didn't believe in forcing\n\n\n     his opinions on others. Demanding because he had high \n     standards for himself and those close to him.\n       It is trite to say that a person left this world a better \n     place, but in his case it is true. Hardly a day goes by \n     without my being stopped and told, ``Your father helped me \n     when my Social Security benefits dried up,'' or ``When my son \n     was injured in Vietnam, Jake Pickle cut through the red tape \n     and got him home.'' What Daddy loved about serving in \n     Congress was the clout he used to get things done. He \n     considered his staff family. Together they accomplished great \n     things.\n       But my assignment today is to talk about Jake Pickle from \n     the standpoint of his family. He was the fourth child in a \n     tight-knit family of seven whose values and work ethic \n     defined the rest of his life. Jake's sister Judith and \n     brother Joe and their families are in this audience, along \n     with the families of deceased sisters Janice and Jeanette. \n     The familial bonds which sustained Jake as a child taught him \n     to treat people and relationships with respect.\n       Jake and Beryl both endured the loss of their first \n     spouse--my mother, Sugar, in 1952, and Beryl's husband, \n     Graham McCarroll, in 1948. In 1960, Beryl and Jake married \n     and began their own family: Jake, Beryl, Dick, Peggy, Graham \n     and a goofy collie dog named Ike. It was a semi-normal life \n     for two years--and then Jake up and announced he was running \n     for the U.S. Congress!\n       Having Jake Pickle for a husband and father was an \n     interesting experience. He was gone a lot. Except in cases of \n     family emergency, work came first. He was ``On Duty'' every \n     day except Christmas, and even then if a constituent had \n     trouble. He believed that public officials are answerable to \n     The People 24-hours-a-day, so our telephone number was listed \n     in the phone book. The phone rang all the time, sometimes at \n     3 a.m., when the constituent was drunk or had an ax to grind.\n\n       Jake loved to work the crowd. One of his favorite places to \n     eat was Luby's Cafeteria because there was that long line of \n     people whose hands he could shake. We all know Jake was tight \n     with a buck. Once he said to me, ``If you've got some money, \n     I'll take you to Luby's.''\n       Sometimes Daddy worked the crowd when I least expected it. \n     One morning 20 years ago, I drove out to Dillards in Barton \n     Creek Mall to buy, of all things, a Weed Whacker. I got there \n     early so I could cut my grass before it got hot, so I was \n     there when the doors opened. I rode the escalator up to the \n     second floor, picked out a Weed Whacker, and took it to the \n     register.\n       By now it was maybe 10:05 a.m., there were few people in \n     the store, and nobody but me in the appliance department. \n     When I wrote the check and gave it to the clerk, he looked at \n     my name on the check and said, ``Pickle? Are you related to \n     Jake Pickle?'' I said I was.\n       ``Well by golly,'' the guy said. ``Mr. Pickle was here this \n     morning, you just missed him.''\n       ``But how?'' I stammered. ``The store just opened!''\n       ``Oh, he addressed our employee meeting at 8 a.m.,'' the \n     clerk said. ``Everybody ate in the lounge. That man sure \n     seems to like his job!''\n       So I paid for my Weed Whacker and left. It was funny, but \n     it also gave me an eerie feeling that Daddy could be \n     anywhere, and probably was. He was always ten steps ahead, \n     with the rest of us scrambling to catch up.\n       Jake was quick to make friends and quick to forgive. It was \n     a wonderful trait for a politician because he made few \n     enemies and nursed no grudges. Both Democrats and Republicans \n     voted for him and worked with him; Jake wasn't partisan, he \n     just wanted to get things done. If at times it was hard to \n     have a legend in the family, it also made us proud. We knew \n     that he was the Gold Standard. The usual temptations like \n     money, women, alcohol and power were no match for Jake's \n     addiction: work. Growing up surrounded by politics, I cannot \n     describe the comfort of knowing that no matter what nastiness \n     was abroad, I would not open the newspaper and read my \n     father's name tainted by scandal.\n       Daddy was a great motivator, and not only about \n     Congressional business, but about Jake Pickle business: his \n     bees, his garden, his pear relish, his longhorns, his stumps \n     that needed rooting at Niederwald. He rallied people with \n     such enthusiasm that it was only later, when you went home, \n     that you realized your aching back and calloused hands were \n     all you had to show for his project.\n       Two of Daddy's other projects concerned Christmas. For \n     years our family had a ``Hats Off to Christmas'' tradition on \n     Christmas morning, as Jake and Beryl distributed hats they \n     had gathered during the year while on junkets--oops!, I mean \n     ``fact finding tours.'' During the 1990s, Daddy, dressed as \n     Santa, arrived in increasingly outrageous ways: in Don Cook's \n     Model A Ford, in a fire truck, on a donkey, in a sidecar \n     motorcycle. He always claimed he wanted to arrive by climbing \n     down a rope ladder from a hovering helicopter, but thank God, \n     he never tried it.\n       Jake didn't care much about stuff--life's fancy trappings--\n     and looking ridiculous never occurred to him. In 1961, when \n     Jake had just been appointed Texas Employment Commissioner, \n     he often drove Dick's used car to work at the fine new TEC \n     office in the Capitol Complex. Dick's '52 Ford was rusty \n     gold, with a '55 front grill, '53 headlights and two bent \n     antennas, but to the new TEC commissioner, it was damn fine \n     transportation.\n       Years ago in Washington, Daddy had a vivid dream in which \n     he was being chased by a bear. In his sleep, he hollered and \n     flew out of bed, cracking his head on the bedside table. \n     Beryl woke to find him holding his bleeding nose, but happy \n     he had outrun the bear. For weeks, my father went to work on \n     Capitol Hill with black eyes that faded to green and yellow. \n     Cheerfully, he told everybody about his dream--and his narrow \n     escape. I always wondered what people thought. Probably oh, \n     that's just Jake!\n       He was a stickler for details, always carrying around a \n     piece of paper and a pen in his coat pocket so he could make \n     notes. It will surprise no one that he helped plan this \n     funeral. He was habitually late because he was always coming \n     from another event--and on his way to the next one. His \n     memory was phenomenal. When he ran into a constituent, he \n     remembered their name, their spouse or where they worked.\n       He loved his family and friends, ice cream, a good story, \n     playing the harmonica, Christmas, the University of Texas, \n     this church, the principles of Democracy, banging on the \n     piano, the hymns of his childhood, dominoes. . . . and a \n     thousand other things. He was innately curious and asked \n     questions constantly. He was a very tough old bird. He \n     endured treatment for cancer which at his age should have \n     killed him, but he hunkered down and got through it. He won \n     remission from cancer an incredible five times. Being \n     weakened irritated him; it cut into his schedule! Right up to \n     the end, he found life interesting. Mom and Pop Pickle \n     whispered in his ear: he always tried to do the right thing.\n       After my father retired from Congress, and during the years \n     of his decline, many of the people in this Sanctuary--and \n     others not present today--came to visit Jake and Beryl. If he \n     worried that once out of the public eye, he would be \n     forgotten, he needn't have. On behalf of our family, we thank \n     you. Your visits, laughter, advice and friendship meant the \n     world to them.\n       My father's legacy is considerable. There are buildings, \n     schools, research facilities, an airport runway and children \n     named after him. Legislation he helped pass changed this \n     country for the better. He counted the mighty among his \n     friends, but treated no person better than another.\n       But of all his legacies, the one I'm most grateful for is \n     his allowing me to be my own person. He raised me with easy \n     affection instead of a preconceived idea of how a little girl \n     should act. As an adult I have come to understand that the \n     worst thing you can do to any person, especially a child, is \n     to stifle their spirit. Jake Pickle made you want to do your \n     best. I can think of no greater accolade for any person.\n       I enjoyed a 59-year relationship with my father. Because he \n     was ill for a long time and I witnessed his suffering, I've \n     already grieved for him. I do not grieve for him today. \n     Instead, I am proud of the person that he was and the life he \n     tried to live, right up to the end.\n       We have other speakers today. As Daddy would say, ``Keep it \n     short. People need to get back to work!''\n       Thank you for being here to help us say goodbye.\n\n                   Eulogy for Congressman J.J. Pickle\n\n                           (By Paul Hilgers)\n\n       Austin, TX, June 22.--Surely you would all know that it is \n     a great honor to be asked to represent the people who worked \n     on Mr. Pickle's staff.\n       Once you were on the staff, it was a lifetime appointment. \n     Whether you were on the payroll or not, it did not matter. We \n     work for him because we love and respect him.\n       Like all Pickle staffers, I never knew how hard I could \n     work in one day, or how many people I could help in one day \n     until I started working with Jake Pickle.\n       We are a proud bunch, those of us who worked in the \n     ``Pickle Factory'' as we called it. I would like to ask all \n     of you who served on Mr. Pickle's staff to stand. There are \n     many more who could not be here today and a few were already \n     doing advance work in heaven.\n       Those who worked in his office understood the importance of \n     their job. Whether it was the District Director, the \n     Administrative Assistant who ran the office in Washington, \n     the legislative assistant, the caseworker, or the person who \n     was on the real front line answering the phone and greeting \n     people, he made you feel that what you were doing was \n     critical. He knew that it all had to work together to \n     properly serve the public. He valued the role we each played.\n       We have a bond that will never be broken, built upon his \n     singular dedication to public service. It is a bond built \n     upon the common experience of knowing this very uncommon man \n     who was so proud of the service we provided together.\n       We are also bound together by the great Pickle stories. \n     Now, Dr. Cunningham, I need to mention just a couple that \n     escaped your remarks about his time at the University. Like \n     the time he got caught stealing turnips from one of his \n     professor's garden. And, while he did love being in Little \n     Campus, there were stories about nailing their roommates \n     furniture upside down to the ceiling. There are so many \n     stories, way too many stories to tell.\n       So, when the staffers get together, only a word or a phrase \n     is needed to spark memories of the experiences we shared: \n     squeaky pickles, the county black books, 1000 acres of \n     beautiful topsoil, the Pickle Float, full tank\n\n\n     of gas and an empty bladder, retrieving that Stetson, the dry \n     run, the Virgil Conn story, playing the harmonica and the \n     piano, the pump organ.\n       There were the annual episodes of serving Venison Chili to \n     the entire House of Representatives every Texas Independence \n     Day, or feeding catfish from the Inks Lake Fish Hatchery to \n     the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee.\n       And stories about parades! Parades with and without squeaky \n     pickles, cars that worked, and cars that did not. Once, there \n     was a car with a stick shift that Ms. Pickle had to drive.\n       Always a convertible so he could be seen and so he could \n     throw his pickles. Parades where he was the Grand Marshall \n     and the first car in the parade, and the one where he \n     followed the horses, after his third parade of the day.\n       At the end of the parade route--Mr. Pickle would stop the \n     car, get out and walk both sides of the route personally \n     shaking every hand and handing out more squeaky pickles.\n       Most of all he was fun--he was fun to be with.\n       Our stories are his lasting legacy to us--which is fitting \n     because he was the master storyteller. He knew how to use \n     humor to communicate his message. He would make people laugh, \n     just before he would make them think about a serious issue \n     facing our Nation or our community.\n       Staffers who took Mr. Pickle to an event were asked two \n     questions just as we arrived: (1) ``what is my key message'', \n     and (2) ``tell me something funny to say.'' We had the old \n     regulars--the Claude Pepper story, the Round Rock story, \n     Dollars for Democrats, but not a Nickel for Pickle story. \n     Many times he would turn to Mrs. Pickle for some of his best \n     material.\n       We worked hard but his sense of humor made the job \n     enjoyable. But, no one worked harder than he did.\n       He would start the week with a 6:20 a.m. flight to \n     Washington on Monday mornings. He would put in 15 hour days \n     in Committee hearings, holding meetings with people from the \n     District or from associations and businesses, casting \n     countless votes on the floor of the House, working the \n     phones, signing the mail, reviewing legislation, and then \n     attending 2-4 receptions before going home to Ms. Beryl.\n       He would keep that schedule everyday until Friday about \n     12:00 noon when he would fly back to Austin at 5:00 p.m. We \n     would go immediately to the office where he would sign all \n     the mail that had been prepared by the District staff that \n     week. He signed virtually every piece of mail that went out \n     of his Office. This is how he kept up with what was happening \n     to his constituents.\n       We would often sign the mail on Friday and see one of those \n     constituents at an event that weekend. He would tell them how \n     their case was going, or that we had just sent off the \n     letter. That made an impression on people--they knew that he \n     cared.\n       He would go to Church on Sunday and we would have some \n     event that evening before I had to get him back to the \n     Airport on Monday mornings. No matter how tired I would get, \n     spending the weekend with Mr. Pickle would re-energize you. \n     His love of public service and his energy was contagious.\n       He campaigned even harder! He was relentless. On weekends, \n     we would have to have three shifts of staff just to keep up!\n       So many times people would say . . . he is the only \n     Democrat I ever voted for . . . or, I don't always agree with \n     him, but I always voted for him. He wanted every vote. He \n     earned every vote.\n       Just one example: a person came to him and asked for help \n     in finding a job--just one of thousands who asked for help. \n     Mr. Pickle sent out the man's resume a number of times who \n     always seemed to be a finalist for the job, but without \n     success. After several months of writing letters and \n     requesting interviews, I asked Mr. Pickle one day while I was \n     driving him home if he had not done enough and why he was \n     trying so hard to help this man?\n       He looked at me and said simply, ``Paul, the man asked me \n     for help. Is there any other reason that I need to try and \n     help him?'' He loved helping people.\n       Mr. Pickle represented the people of Central Texas to the \n     Federal government, but he was also a representative of the \n     Federal government to the people of Central Texas. He loved \n     welcoming people from the District to Washington. No one gave \n     a tour of the Capital like a Jake Pickle tour of the Capital. \n     He took people in places where you just are not supposed to \n     go. He made the Capital come alive with its history.\n       He had a vision and a love for Central Texas that no one \n     could match. He was our strongest lobbyist and he lobbied for \n     so many things in addition to UT and SEMATECH. Boggy Creek, a \n     Wildlife Refuge, airports (big ones and small ones), the \n     right of way for MoKan. He worked on behalf of the Austin \n     Housing Authority, the Boy Scouts, Veterans Outpatient \n     Clinic, IRS Service Center, the LCRA, Bergstrom Air Force \n     Base, Flood Control on the Upper San Marcos Watershed, the \n     Visitors Center at the LBJ National Park, the Gary Job Corps, \n     and literally a thousand other things for Central Texans.\n       Yes, Mr. Pickle worked hard for Central Texas, but he was \n     one of Washington's most respected members of Congress. He \n     believed in having personal relationships with other members \n     of Congress . . . on both sides of the aisle. This is evident \n     by those in attendance today.\n       Integrity, Honesty, Loyalty, Courage, Determination, \n     Tenacity--these are the qualities that he relied upon to \n     become a trusted legislator. These are the qualities that \n     defined Jake Pickle.\n       Of all of the legislative work and votes over 31 years, he \n     took the greatest pride in one of his first: the Civil Rights \n     Act. He would get tears in his eyes every time he told the \n     story when President Johnson called him the night the Civil \n     Rights Act passed. The President demanded that Mr. Pickle \n     call him no matter what time of night so he could tell him \n     how proud he was of his vote.\n       He was also proud of his work as Chairman of the Ways and \n     Means Subcommittees of Social Security and Oversight. His \n     most important legislative accomplishment was in maintaining \n     solvency of the Social Security system in 1983. He worked \n     closely with Senator Bob Dole on legislation that represented \n     a bi-partisan approach to the problem. He told me many times \n     that providing a sense of security to tens of millions of \n     Americans gave him a deep sense of pride and meaning.\n       Third, was his work in the area of pensions and pension \n     reform. He could see problems in the system long before they \n     became the crisis they are today. In fact, if not for some of \n     the reforms he put into place, the crisis would be much \n     greater today. He would say pensions are not a very \n     newsworthy subject, but it was damned important to families \n     counting on them.\n       The J. J. Pickle formula for success in government was \n     really very simple: a dedication to public service plus a \n     love of helping people, multiplied by a deep faith in our \n     system of government.\n       He placed the highest priority on constituent service \n     because he thought the highest calling of government was to \n     help people with their problems. He was committed to being \n     responsive and accessible.\n       Mr. Pickle often referred to the Congressional Office as \n     ``the big buffer'' between the individual and ``big \n     government.'' It was the place where any citizen, rich or \n     poor, democrat or republican, could come for help when there \n     was nowhere else to turn.\n       Finally, Mr. Pickle had a truly unique ability to balance a \n     short-term immediate focus with his long-term vision. He \n     taught us that the best public policy always made the best \n     politics.\n       Social Security legislation was to be based upon solvency \n     of the system, pension policy based on protecting the pension \n     holders not big business, civil rights legislation based on \n     justice and equal protection.\n       Locally, his long-term vision included the need for inter-\n     modal transportation systems, two runways at Bergstrom \n     Airport, flood control systems, public power, solar energy, \n     habitat for endangered species and protection of water \n     quality, a first class research facility at UT's Balcones \n     Research Center that bears his name.\n       There is a phrase he used in some of his later speeches, \n     ``In the Shadows of Greatness''. Referring to the portion of \n     MoPac north of U.S. Hwy 183 that runs between MCC and the \n     J.J. Pickle Research Campus--he talked about how people would \n     drive through that corridor not realizing that they were \n     actually traveling ``in the shadows of greatness'' because of \n     the world class research being conducted in the buildings \n     they were passing by.\n       Those of us on the Pickle staff understand a different \n     meaning for this phrase. We worked in the Shadows of \n     Greatness every day we were with him. He had an impact on \n     this world and particularly on this community that is--as he \n     predicted--already being forgotten by most.\n       But, his fingerprints are everywhere. His legacy of public \n     service, of loyalty to his University, of his commitment to \n     good and responsive government has been recognized through \n     the naming of the Federal Building, the Research Center, the \n     Elementary School, the Pickle Runway at Bergstrom Airport, \n     and even a peach orchard on Town Lake.\n       So, on behalf of your eternal staff . . . we will never \n     forget what you taught us. We will always celebrate and \n     treasure our time with you. My prayer is that you are \n     already--cheating at dominoes with all of your friends--\n     friends who have been waiting so long for you. I am confident \n     that the quality of life in heaven just got better.\n       God Bless You, Great Leader, for your service, for your \n     legacy, for giving us the opportunity work in your great \n     shadow!\n       We had a great ride!!\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DOGGETT", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "99", "extension": true, "year": "2005", "vol": "151", "pages": "E1552-E1554", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "20", "month": "July"}, "doc_title": "IN REMEMBRANCE OF J.J.
